                <description><![CDATA[<p>Hello folks.</p>

<p>After many years without touch my personal website, I took the decision to put it back online.</p>

<p>Recently I have been writing technical documentation in Spanish in the website <a href="http://7sabores.com" target="_blank">7Sabores.com</a>. If you are wondering Why in Spanish? and if you read Spanish you can find my justification in the blog entry <a href='http://7sabores.com/blog/se-busca-en-espanol'>¿Se busca en Español?</a>.</p>

<p>I will not translate all my Spanish entries to English or viceversa, all depends my mood :P.</p>

<p>Also I have to say THANKS YOU to two great products <a targe="_blank" href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> and <a href="http://spress.yosymfony.com/">[S]press</a>. Without them this blog couldn't be possible.</p>

<p>See you around.</p>

                <title>How to configure MySQL to import large database</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>On many occasions we need to install in our local enviroment a copy of production sites for development or debugging process, this entails that need to import large databases.</p>

<p>The most common error is that you cannot import the database because for some reason you loose the communication with the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> server, as shown below.</p>

<pre><code>$ /mysql -f -uroot -proot mydb -h 127.0.0.1 &lt; ~/Downloads/prod-mysql-2013-01-29.sql
ERROR 2006 (HY000) at line 6565: MySQL server has gone away
</code></pre>

<p>To fix this error you must to change the default configuration of MySQL.</p>

<p>MySQL store his configuration in a file commonly named my.cnf and could be located in different locations depending the OS version you have installed.</p>

<p>If you do not know the location of this file, you can use the following command shown below to determine where you expect to find locations MySQL settings.</p>

<pre><code>$ ./mysql --help | grep my.cnf
/etc/my.cnf /etc/mysql/my.cnf /Applications/MAMP/conf/my.cnf ~/.my.cnf
</code></pre>

<p>In my case I had MySQL as part of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mamp.info/">MAMP</a> and this file is not created by default. For this reason I will create a new file located at <em>/Applications/MAMP/conf/my.cnf</em> becuase is one of the location where MySQL will look his configuration file.</p>

<p>I recommend to use the sample provided by MySQL documentation for large databases localed at <em>/usr/share/doc/mysql-server-5.0/examples/my-large.cnf.gz.</em></p>

<p>After copy the suggested configuration from documantion, I have to apply two changes to warranty the import process don't fail.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Remove Directive # <em>skip-locking</em></p></li>
<li><p>Increase setting <em>max_allowed_packet = 100M</em></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Then just be enough restart the MySQL server and try to import the database again.</p>

<p>You can check my version of my.cnf <a target="_blank" href="http://7sabores.com/sites/default/files/my.cnf_.txt">here</a></p>

                <title>What is Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>Nowdays is pretty common to transfer data between web applications via Web Services to  clients that require information on different interfaces such as REST, XMLRPC, JSON, JSON-RPC, SOAP and others.</p>

<p>Almost all sites today are built using JavaScript, generating AJAX calls with XMLHttpRequest mechanism to get information  from external sites. To enable this kind of comunication is necessary implement "cross-domain" requests would otherwise be forbidden by web browsers, per the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy">same origin security policy</a>.</p>

<p>Lets imagine the following scenery: we have a frontend application using the domain http://a.com and this application wants to use data provided by a  backend site located in domain http://b.com. For security this type of communication is blocked and the end user will be only able to get the information from http://a.com, this scenario is exemplified in the following image.</p>

<p><img src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/crossdomain.png"/></p>

<p>To enable this kind of communication is requiered that your backed server (http//b.com) returns the specific HTTP Headers to enable CORS comunication. Below you can see an example of HTTP Header required.</p>

<pre><code>Access-Control-Allow-Credentials:true
Access-Control-Allow-Headers:X-CSRF-Token
Access-Control-Allow-Methods:POST,ADD,GET,PUT,DELETE,OPTIONS
Access-Control-Allow-Origin:http://localhost:8080
</code></pre>

<p>The header <em>Access-Control-Allow-Credentials</em> is only used if your request require some kind of authentication. You can read more information about all HTTP Headers at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS">Access Controls - CORS</a>.</p>

                <title>What is and how it works RequireJS</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p><a target="_blank" href="http://requirejs.org/">RequireJS</a> is a JavaScript library that allows us to isolate the components of our JS application as modules and resolve their dependencies.</p>

<p>RequireJS implements the design pattern of software <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_module_definition">AMD</a> (Asynchronous Module Definition) which you could say is very similar to <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection">Dependency injection</a> implemented by frameworks like <a target="_blank" href="http://symfony.com/">Symfony</a>.</p>

<p>Let's check how we can use in our JS application in simple steps.</p>

<h2>1. Define entry point for RequireJS.</h2>

<p>We must download the lastest version of RequireJS library available on the website <a target="_blank" href="http://requirejs.org">http://requirejs.org</a>, after download will put in a directory called libs just for purposes of this example (tested with version 2.1.11).</p>

<p>Now we need to  define a html file and could named index.html where RequireJS is loading as shown below.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;script data-main="libs/main" src="libs/require.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see the inclusión is done with the script tag at the end of the HTML tag body, but it could also be done within the head tag.</p>

<p>It's also possible to include RequireJS remotely using the URL <a target="_blank" href="http://requirejs.org/docs/release/2.1.11/minified/require.js">http://requirejs.org/docs/release/2.1.11/minified/require.js</a> or similar, but it is a desition of the reader.</p>

<p>As can be seen RequireJS  use the meta-data property <em>data-main</em>(, with this property we can define the entry point for RequireJS configuration, which is a relative path for the file we choose to load teh RequireJS configuraton (is necesarry exlude the js extension).</p>

<h2>2. Configure RequireJS</h2>

<p>In the file libs/main.js we define the RequireJS options. The first thing we should to define is which JS libraries will use in our application as shown below.</p>

<pre><code>require.config({
    baseUrl: 'libs',
    paths : {
      backbone : 'backbone',
      underscore : 'underscore',
      jquery : 'jquery',
      marionette : 'backbone.marionette',
      wreqr : 'backbone.wreqr',
      eventbinder : 'backbone.eventbinder',
      babysitter : 'backbone.babysitter'
  }
});
</code></pre>

<p>All files are seek in the directory defined using the <em>baseUrl</em> property, and the <em>paths</em> property allow define the location of the libraries required with a key to refer to the library later. The js extension is not required and will be added by RequireJS later.</p>

<p>As its name suggests the pattern AMD makes an asynchronous load of packages. But because not all the libraries implement the AMD pattern, is likely to a library A try to use a function defined in library B not yet loaded causing a fatal error.</p>

<p>To resolve this issue we use the property <em>Shim</em> part of  RequireJS configuration, as we see below.</p>

<pre><code>require.config({,
  shim : {
    jquery : {
      exports : 'jQuery'
    },
    underscore : {
      exports : '_'
    },
    backbone : {
      deps : ['jquery', 'underscore'],
      exports : 'Backbone'
    },
    wreqr: {
      deps : ['backbone']
    },
    eventbinder : {
      deps : ['backbone']
    },
    babysitter : {
      deps: ['backbone']
    },
    marionette : {
      deps: ['wreqr', 'eventbinder', 'babysitter'],
      exports : 'Marionette'
    }
  }
});
</code></pre>

<p>Using Shim we can define dependencies between libraries and allow to export global variables that can be used within other libraries such as jQuery library which  export  the variable jQuery.</p>

<p>The configuration with the Shim is a replacement for Order plugin used before version 2.0 of RequireJS.</p>

<p>The exports variable can also be an anonymous function to return the call noConflict function, if the library supports it.</p>

<p>Using the <em>deps</em> property, you can define multiple dependencies of libraries should be loaded before including the library that are defining, such as backbone that depends on jquery and underscore to be used.</p>

<p>Of course if we want to use the library with RequireJS  and supports AMD configuration pattern Shim isn't required.</p>

<h2>3. How to execute code required.</h2>

<p>Once defined libraries and its dependencies if necessary, we can now rewrite the code we need as shown below.</p>

<pre><code>// Loading dependences and execute Marionette App
require( ["marionette"], function (Marionette) {
    // set up the app instance
    var MyApp = new Marionette.Application();
 
    MyApp.on("initialize:after", function(){
      alert("Application has started!");
    });
 
    MyApp.start();
});
</code></pre>

<p>The above code checks that all the libraries needed to run Marionette are loaded before executing the code and get the exported global variable as a parameter.</p>

<p>In the anonymous function will create a Marionette Application and start it, As result we  will get an alert with the message "Application has started".</p>

<p>The require function has the same effect of an anonymous function, meaning that run without problems but can not be used later.</p>

<h2>4. How to create named modules.</h2>

<p>If we want encapsulate our App we must create named modules using the funcion <em>define</em>; The diference with require function is  an extra parameter that is used to name the module and returns an object or variable that will be used when the module is instantiated.</p>

<p>Then consider the previous example as a named module.</p>

<pre><code>define( 'MyApp', ["marionette"], function (Marionette) {
 
    // set up the app instance
    var MyApp = new Marionette.Application();
 
    MyApp.on("initialize:after", function(){
      alert("Application has started!");
    });
 
    // export the app from this module
    return MyApp;
});
 
// Fetch and execute Marionette App
require( ["MyApp"], function (MyApp) {
    // Execute App
    MyApp.start();
});
</code></pre>

<p>As you see we register a named module <em>MyApp</em> and  returns an object defined in Marionette.</p>

<p>Then with a <em>require</em> function the module is loaded, it receives as parameters the object returns by the module and can thus start our application.</p>

<p>It might seem a waste of time doing it this way as it is in the same file, but the idea is to create a module for file and using the configuration of RequireJS load all the libraries that define modules and then use these modules in our application.</p>

<p>You can download the <a target="_blank" href="http://enzolutions.com/projects/marionettejs_skeleton_app">Marionette App Skeleton</a> repository which implements the concepts discussed here.</p>

<p>I hope you have been to his liking.</p>

                <title>Introduction to Grunt</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p><img style="float:left; margin-right: 20px;;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/grunt-logo.png"/> Today I come to speak of some of those tools that are part of the set of Hot and Sexy for all developers speak nowadays, much to our regret if another tool that apparently there is more to learn: P.</p>

<p>From my own experience I know how difficult it is to have enough time to learn all these Sexy tools, I'll try to explain it in the most practical and easiest way possible.</p>

<h2>What's Grunt.?</h2>

<p>Grunt is a tool to automate tasks is our web projects. The idea is that all of those routine tasks that we do in our projects Grunt make them for us. Among the most common tasks are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Concat files (CSS, JS, etc)</li>
<li>Minify files (CSS, JS, etc)</li>
<li>Optimize images.</li>
<li>Compilation (SASS -> CSS and others)</li>
<li>Unit Test</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these tasks is implemented by a Grunt plugin, which today has nearly three thousand plugins, you can see the full list of plugins in <a targe="_blank" href="http://gruntjs.com/plugins">http://gruntjs.com/plugins</a>.</p>

<p>Grunt is built with is Javascript  and require <a target="_blank" href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> to be executed which makes Grunt multi platform.</p>

<h2>How install Grunt.</h2>

<p>As I said earlier Grunt uses Node.js to run, but you don't need to know anything about Node.js to use Grunt, is only required to install and execute, it in the same way we you don't need to know Java to run programs that use the Java JRE.</p>

<p>The first is to install Node.js, you can find an installer for your platform at <a target="_blank" href="http://nodejs.org/download/">http://nodejs.org/download/</a>.</p>

<p>After install Node.js we will have NPM (Node Packaged Modules) available, NPM allows us to install packages, all packages available are listed in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.npmjs.org">https://www.npmjs.org</a>. Right now there are almost 80,000 packages and one of them is Grunt.</p>

<p>Now we have to install the package <a target="_blank" href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/grunt-cli">grunt-cli</a>, grunt-cli is a command line interface to interact with grunt. Use the following command to install it.</p>

<pre><code>npm install grunt-cli -g
</code></pre>

<p>The -g option indicates that the package will be install in overall system instead of local.</p>

<p>Now to install the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/grunt">grunt</a> package to execute tasks we have two options.</p>

<h3>Defining package.json</h3>

<p>In our application we need to create a file named <em>package.json</em> that will read by the npm command:</p>

<pre><code>{
  "name": "example-project",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "devDependencies": {
    "grunt": "~0.4.1"
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then run the command:</p>

<pre><code>$ npm install
</code></pre>

<p>The previous command will read and process the package.json file; installing grunt and his dependencies. Generating an output similar to the following list:</p>

<pre><code>grunt@0.4.5 node_modules/grunt
├── which@1.0.5
├── dateformat@1.0.2-1.2.3
├── eventemitter2@0.4.13
├── getobject@0.1.0
├── rimraf@2.2.8
├── colors@0.6.2
├── hooker@0.2.3
├── async@0.1.22
├── grunt-legacy-util@0.2.0
├── exit@0.1.2
├── lodash@0.9.2
├── coffee-script@1.3.3
├── underscore.string@2.2.1
├── iconv-lite@0.2.11
├── nopt@1.0.10 (abbrev@1.0.5)
├── minimatch@0.2.14 (sigmund@1.0.0, lru-cache@2.5.0)
├── grunt-legacy-log@0.1.1 (underscore.string@2.3.3, lodash@2.4.1)
├── findup-sync@0.1.3 (lodash@2.4.1, glob@3.2.11)
├── glob@3.1.21 (inherits@1.0.0, graceful-fs@1.2.3)
└── js-yaml@2.0.5 (esprima@1.0.4, argparse@0.1.15)
</code></pre>

<p>Grunt and his dependencies remain within the node_modules folder and our directory tree will be similar to the following list:</p>

<pre><code>$ tree -L 3
.
├── node_modules
│   └── grunt
│       ├── CONTRIBUTING.md
│       ├── LICENSE-MIT
│       ├── README.md
│       ├── appveyor.yml
│       ├── internal-tasks
│       ├── lib
│       ├── node_modules
│       └── package.json
└── package.json
</code></pre>

<h3>Generate dependencies in package.json</h3>

<p>If you do not know which version of Grunt we need, we can request to NPM to auto generated grunt dependencies and store in package.json file. We have to create a create a generic package.json file as shown below:</p>

<pre><code>{
  "name": "example-project",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "devDependencies": {
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now run the installation of grunt informing we want auto generate dependencies as shown in the following command:</p>

<pre><code>$ npm install grunt --save-dev
</code></pre>

<p>After installing grunt and his dependencies our archive package.json will look similar to below:</p>

<pre><code>{
  "name": "example-project",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "devDependencies": {
    "grunt": "^0.4.5"
  }
}
</code></pre>

<h2>How to create Grunt Tasks.</h2>

<p>At this point we have everything you need to start building tasks you want to use, the first thing to do is create a Gruntfile.js file to define the tasks to automate.</p>

<p>Let's check a minimum file Grunt.</p>

<pre><code>'use strict';
 
module.exports = function (grunt) {
 
    grunt.initConfig({
        pkg: grunt.file.readJSON('package.json'),
    });
 
    // Where we tell Grunt we plan to use some plug-ins.
    //grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-xxxx');
 
 
    // Where we tell Grunt what to do when we type "grunt" into the terminal.
    //grunt.registerTask('default', ['xxxx']);
};
</code></pre>

<p>As seen the file has 3 sections.</p>

<ul>
<li>Initconfig: In this area we define tasks to be execute by Grunt</li>
<li>LoadNpmTask: You should make a proper load plugin for the tasks we wish to define.</li>
<li>RegisterTask: We must register the tasks to be run, they can be less than defined tasks.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Install Grunt plugin.</h3>

<p>As an example we will install the plugin <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-concat">concat</a> to merge files, run the following command inside the folder of your project.</p>

<pre><code>$ npm install grunt-contrib-concat --save-dev
</code></pre>

<p>The option - save-dev  amending package.json to add the dependency in file.</p>

<h3>Plugin usage.</h3>

<p>With the plugin concat installed, now we just have to configure in Gruntfile.js file as shown below.</p>

<pre><code>'use strict';
 
module.exports = function (grunt) {
 
    grunt.initConfig({
        pkg: grunt.file.readJSON('package.json'),
        concat: {
            dist: {
                src: [
                    'js/libs/*.js', // All JS in the libs folder
                    '/js/global.js'  // This specific file
                ],
                dest: '/js/build/production.js',
            }
        }
    });
 
    // Where we tell Grunt we plan to use some plug-ins.
    grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-concat');
 
    // Where we tell Grunt what to do when we type "grunt" into the terminal.
    grunt.registerTask('default', ['concat']);
};
</code></pre>

<p>With this definition we indicate where the files are and where we want the concatenate file be stored, then we load the NPM package and finally register the task.</p>

<p>As you can see on the origin of the files to be concatenated we can use the special character * to define a large group of files.</p>

<h3>Execute task.</h3>

<p>To run the task we just use one of the following commands:</p>

<pre><code>$ grunt
 
$ grunt concat
</code></pre>

<p>The first command runs all available tasks and the second specifies the concat task, as we only have one tasks the result will be the same and we will get an output similar to the following.</p>

<pre><code>Running "concat:dist" (concat) task
File "web/js/build/production.js" created.
 
Done, without errors.
</code></pre>

<p>We can continue increasing our tasks, for instance use output of concat to add a task to minify the file.</p>

<p>All depends on what you need, the limit are  plugins available in grunt (nearly 3,000) and the needs of your project.</p>

<p>I hope you have been to his liking.</p>

                <title>Routing and Controlling with MarionetteJS</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p><a target="_blank" href="http://marionettejs.com/">MarionetteJS</a>  is a layer that sits on <a target="_blank" href="http://backbonejs.org">BackboneJS</a> to create scalable and professional applications.</p>

<p>Some features of MarionetteJS are :</p>

<ul>
<li>Scalable: applications are built in modules, and with event-driven architecture</li>
<li>Sensible defaults: Underscore templates are used for view rendering</li>
<li>Easily modifiable: make it work with your application's specific needs</li>
<li>Reduce boilerplate for views, with specialized view types</li>
<li>Build on a modular architecture with an Application and modules that attach to it</li>
<li>Compose your application's visuals at runtime, with the Region and Layout objects</li>
<li>Nested views and layouts within visual regions</li>
<li>Built-in memory management and zombie-killing in views, regions and layouts</li>
<li>Event-driven architecture with Backbone.Wreqr.EventAggregator</li>
<li>Flexible, "as-needed" architecture allowing you to pick and choose what you need</li>
<li>And much, much more</li>
</ul>

<p>In this example I will take the structure of libraries and dependencies explained in the blog entry <a target="_blank" href="http://enzolutions.com/articles/2014/06/01/what-is-and-how-it-works-requirejs/">What is and how it works RequireJS</a> to create a MarionetteJS application.</p>

<h1>1. Router Module.</h1>

<p>MarionetteJS  implements the object <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/blob/master/docs/marionette.approuter.md">Marionette.AppRouter</a> that allows you to define the paths that respond to your application. Using <a target="_blank" href="http://requirejs.org/">RequireJS</a> we can create a module that defines an object for our routes, also allows us to create multiple  Route objects that can be instantiated for other applications by convenience.</p>

<p>In our application we create a folder where modules live, named modules. See an example definition of a Route.</p>

<pre><code>define(["marionette"], function (Marionette) {
  var Router = Marionette.AppRouter.extend({
    appRoutes: {
      "": "home",
    },
    /* standard routes can be mixed with appRoutes/Controllers above */
    routes : {
      "hello/:username": "helloBuddy"
    },
    helloBuddy : function (buddy) {
      // Without controller the routing functions live in Router object
      alert("Hello " + buddy);
    }
  });
 
  return Router;
});
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see the code has an anonymus definition that returns a Router object, which then will be required for our application.</p>

<p>Then we must define the properties that are response functions of our application routes.</p>

<p><em>AppRoutes</em>: Property that allows the definition of routes with convention: URL : Method Name, the method must be defined in the Controller module that is associated with the Route within the application. This option allows the response functions change dramatically, depending on the controller being involved in Route.</p>

<p><em>routes</em>: Property that defines routes, but unlike the previous methods will be defined within the Router object. This option ensures that certain (s) routes have a specific desired behavior.</p>

<p>Both properties can be used in the same definition without problem, but the routes should not be repeated.</p>

<p>When the application starts the Router indicate which methods are executed in response to a route visited by a user.</p>

<p>In the definition of Route we use the property routes with dynamic parameters. in the  route hello:username, username is a dynamic value passed as a parameter to the method of response to the route.</p>

<h2>2. Controller Module.</h2>

<p>In the same way we did  for Routing will create a module for the controller, as shown below</p>

<pre><code>define(["marionette"], function (Marionette) {
 
    var Controller = Marionette.Controller.extend({
        initialize : function(options) {
             //TODO: code to initialize
         },
        start: function() {
            //TODO: code to start
        },
 
        /**
         * Initialized on start, without hash
         * @method
         */
         home :  function () {
            alert('Hello Marionette');
        },
    });
 
    return Controller;
});
</code></pre>

<p>This module is anonymous and extend the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/blob/master/docs/marionette.controller.md">Marionette.Controller</a> object as seen have initialize and start methods to perform tasks that are required at the time of the creation of the controller.</p>

<p>Then you must define the properties that are response functions of our application routes. In our case we define the hello method.</p>

<h2>3. Invoking Controller  and Router</h2>

<p>When we declare our application we load the objects that define the Router and Controller, as shown below.</p>

<pre><code>// Loading dependences and module to execute Marionette App
require( ["marionette","../modules/AppRouter", "../modules/AppController"], function (Marionette, AppRouter, AppController) {
    // set up the app instance
    var MyApp = new Marionette.Application();
 
    // initialize the app controller
    var controller = new AppController({});
 
    // initialize the app router
    MyApp.addInitializer(function(options) {
        // initialize the router
        var router = new AppRouter({
          controller : controller
        });
    });
 
    MyApp.on("initialize:after", function(){
      // Start Backbone history a necessary step for bookmarkable URL's
      Backbone.history.start();
    });
 
    MyApp.start({});
});
</code></pre>

<p>Although Route and Controller modules were anonymous, using RequireJS we can do load modules using the relative path of the modules as shown in detail in the next line.</p>

<pre><code>require( ["marionette","../modules/AppRouter", "../modules/AppController"], function (Marionette, AppRouter, AppController) {
</code></pre>

<p>The returned objects are passed as a parameter to the anonymous function that defines the application.</p>

<p>As seen proceeds to create an instance of the Controller object, which will be later used in the definition of the Router.</p>

<pre><code>// initialize the app controller
var controller = new AppController({});
</code></pre>

<p>In the initialization of our MarionetteJS application, we create the Router using the Controller.</p>

<pre><code>// initialize the app router
MyApp.addInitializer(function(options) {
  // initialize the router
  var router = new AppRouter({
    controller : controller
  });
});
</code></pre>

<p>Finally after finishing the initialization of our application should be activated BackboneJS history of what that will activate the process of routing.</p>

<pre><code>MyApp.on("initialize:after", function(){
  // Start Backbone history a necessary step for bookmarkable URL's
  Backbone.history.start();
});
</code></pre>

<p>When it loads the application we will getan alert with the message "Hello Marionette" and if you change the URL to index.html#hello/ enzo you will get a resul similar to the following output.</p>

                <title>How to configure MySQL to import large database</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>On many occasions we need to install in our local machine production sites for development or just for faster debugging, this entails that we need to import very large databases.</p>

<p>The most common mistake is that you can not import the database, returning an error that communication with the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> server has been lost, as shown below.</p>

<pre><code>$ /mysql -f -uroot -proot mydb -h 127.0.0.1 &lt; ~/Downloads/prod-mysql-2013-01-29.sql
ERROR 2006 (HY000) at line 6565: MySQL server has gone away
$
</code></pre>

<p>To fix this error you must change the default configuration of MySQL, if you do not know the location of this file can use the command shown below to determine at which locations MySQL expects to find the configuration.</p>

<pre><code>$ ./mysql --help | grep my.cnf
/etc/my.cnf /etc/mysql/my.cnf /Applications/MAMP/conf/my.cnf ~/.my.cnf
$
</code></pre>

<p>In my case I have MySQL provided by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mamp.info">MAMP</a>, so I need create a file in the location /Applications/MAMP/conf/my.cnf, based on a configuration for large databases which is available in the documentation MySQL and should be available in the path <em>/usr/share/doc/mysql-server-5.0/examples/my-large.cnf.gz</em>.</p>

<p>I will apply two changes to enable big importations.</p>

<ul>
<li>Remover Directive # skip-locking</li>
<li>Increase max_allowed_packet = 100M</li>
</ul>

<p>Then you just need restart the MySQL server and try to import the database again.</p>

<p>You can find my version of my.cnf <a target="_blank" href="http://enzolutions.com/assets/attaches/my.cnf.txt">here</a>.</p>

                <title>Introduction to Bower</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p><img style="float:left; margin-right: 20px;;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/bower-logo.png"/> Continuing with the serie <em>Hot &amp; Sexy tools</em> available these days for web developers started with the entry of Blog <a target="_blank" href="http://enzolutions.com/articles/2014/06/18/introduction-to-grunt/">Introduction to Grunt</a>, now I come to speak of <a target="_blank" href="http://bower.io/">Bower</a>.</p>

<p>Bower by definition is a package manager for the web, now that simple English means a tool that allows us to define required libraries in our web applications and the bower detect the dependencies of required packages.</p>

<p>When bower check all package dependencies requested and find any inconsistency. It presents a menu to choose which version you want to use.</p>

<p>Now if you ask what kind of packages are available, ranging from packets like <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jquery/jquery">jQuery</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap">Bootstrap</a> to <a target="_blank"href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux">Linux</a>. All depends on what are our project needs, today bower has nearly fourteen thousand packages.</p>

<h2>How to install Bower.</h2>

<p>Bower is a npm package therefore <a target="_blank" href="http://npmjs.org/">Node.js</a> is needed, with the following command we can install Bower.</p>

<pre><code>$ npm install -g bower
</code></pre>

<p>With the above command bower would be available to all system users.</p>

<h2>How to use Bower.</h2>

<p>Once Bower is installed you can use immediately in your application to download the packages you want, let's say you need jQuery in your project, well you only need to use the following command to include it.</p>

<pre><code>$ bower install jQuery
</code></pre>

<p>The above command will have the following output, which informs us that versión of jQuery was downloaded.</p>

<pre><code>bower cached        git://github.com/jquery/jquery.git#2.1.1
bower validate      2.1.1 against git://github.com/jquery/jquery.git#*
bower install       jQuery#2.1.1
</code></pre>

<p>If you're wondering where jQuery is installed in the directory where you run the command, you would have a structure similar to the following representation:</p>

<pre><code>.
└── bower_components
    └── jQuery
        ├── MIT-LICENSE.txt
        ├── bower.json
        ├── dist
        └── src
</code></pre>

<p>You see you get the minimized version of jQuery and files for normal development of jQuery is up to us to decide what files must be include in our application.</p>

<p>If you want a specific package version you must provide this information in the install process as shown in the following command:</p>

<pre><code>$ bower install &lt;package&gt;#&lt;version&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>Group project dependencies.</h2>

<p>As we saw is quite easy to add new components, but it depends on someone memory  to install the required packages, to define all the required packages for our project we use the bower.json file.</p>

<p>Fortunately bower provides us a command that lets you create a basic bower.json file, you can see an output of interactive command <em>$ bower init</em>.</p>

<pre><code>$ bower init
[?] name: MegaProject
[?] version: 0.1.0-alpha
[?] description: Not Available
[?] main file: assets/js/main.js, assets/css/main.css
[?] what types of modules does this package expose?
[?] keywords: HTML5
[?] authors: enzo - Eduardo Garcia &lt;enzo@anexusit.com&gt;
[?] license: MIT
[?] homepage: http://enzolutions.com
[?] set currently installed components as dependencies? Yes
[?] add commonly ignored files to ignore list? Yes
[?] would you like to mark this package as private which prevents it from being [?] would you like to mark this package as private which prevents it from being accidentally published to the registry? No
</code></pre>

<p>This command above will generate a file called bower.json with the following content.</p>

<pre><code>{
  "name": "MegaProject",
  "version": "0.1.0-alpha",
  "authors": [
    "enzo - Eduardo Garcia &lt;enzo@anexusit.com&gt;"
  ],
  "description": "Not Available",
  "main": "assets/js/main.js, assets/css/main.css",
  "keywords": [
    "HTML5"
  ],
  "license": "MIT",
  "homepage": "http://enzolutions.com",
  "ignore": [
    "**/.*",
    "node_modules",
    "bower_components",
    "test",
    "tests"
  ],
  "dependencies": {
    "jQuery": "~2.1.1"
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now what advantage we get from file bower.js file? The first one is portability because we just need put this file in our version control system and when a new developer arrive to team for sure we will need set up his environment; then he just need download the bower.json and run the following command:</p>

<pre><code>$ bower install
</code></pre>

<p>In this case bower detects the existence of a bower.json file and will proceed to install packages included in the file, allowing us to maintain our system clean and avoid having stored 50 versions of jQuery when in the end we are interested in last version of jQuery.</p>

<h2>Specify destination packages.</h2>

<p>As we saw before the default destination is <em>bower_components</em> folder, but it is very likely that this location is not to our liking, if we want to specify a custom destination folder we need to create a file .bowerrc to inform bower about our needs, as shown below.</p>

<pre><code>{
    "directory": "web/vendor"
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which will make the packets are stored in the folder <em>web/vendor</em> or any other you want.</p>

<p>I hope you have been to his liking.</p>

                <title>Mi Tribu</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>This is an oratory I did in Spanish for my son Axel to present to his classroom, he is coursing right now 3rd grade.</p>

<p>¿Qué es ser Tico?</p>

<p>Esta es una pregunta que puede ser fácil de responder para muchos, pero si lo piensan un poco mejor puede que no seamos 100% ticos en los que se entiende generalmente.</p>

<p>¿Quien es más tico? un indio Cabécar de la zona de Talamanca o un niño recién nacido en San Carlos?, bueno todo depende de los ojos y la tolerancia con que se mire.</p>

<p>Más del 95% de la población en Costa Rica puede rastrear sus ancestros no más allá de 500 años que fue la época de llegada de los españoles, bajo esta definición sólo los indígenas sin mezcla podrías ser denominados ticos.</p>

<p>Lo curioso es que ellos mismos no se definen como ticos sino como miembros de su tribu, lo que me hace pensar que quizás es suficiente que nosotros sepamos a qué tribu pertenecemos.</p>

<p>Yo, por ejemplo, soy un Tico algo particular, nací en Chepe para decirlo en tico, pero mis padres son colombianos, por lo que se podría decir que soy Colombiano, lo cual me conviene en términos de Fútbol pensando en James Rodríguez y demás jugadores de la Selección de Colombia que hicieron un buen papel en el mundial de Brasil.</p>

<p>Los que negativamente dicen que no soy tico, les puedo decir que en toda mi vida solo he estado 2 semanas fuera de Costa Rica y siento este país mío, como el más tico de todos.</p>

<p>Para mí el ser tico significa que lo acepte yo, y que así lo acepten los demás miembros de mi tribu que son mi familia, vecinos, compañeros de escuela y nuevas personas que se van integrando a mi vida.</p>

<p>Por eso los invito a preocuparnos más en qué podemos hacer, para que nuestro país cada día sea mejor sin importar a qué tribu pertenecemos, porque a final de cuentas todos venimos siendo turistas en este lindo país</p>

<p>Pura Vida.</p>

                <title>How to Generate TOC in Github/BitBucket projects</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>Nowadays using version control systems like <a href="http://github.com/">Github</a> or <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a> for our projects is pretty popular because of their flexibility.</p>

<p>When we are starting our projects both systems recommends the creation of a README.md file to provide an introduction to our projects, but it could turn into documentation.</p>

<p>At first moment the MD extension were not familiar for us and it's normal. The MD extension stands for MarkDown which is a series of dialing rules that will generate a HTML without knowing HTML for tags like bold, subtitle and other special labels in a similar way to that done by <a href="http://wikipedia.org">http://wikipedia.org</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to know a little more about MarkDown you can check the version of Github at <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown">https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown</a> and BitBucket version at  <a href="https://bitbucket.org/tutorials/markdowndemo">https://bitbucket.org/tutorials/markdowndemo</a>.</p>

<p>When we have mastered the MarkDown creating sections within our document, the natural evolution is to make a table of contents to make it easier to navigate through Readme file doing our project more professional, but this task can be cumbersome luckily we will see below a tool that does this job for us.</p>

<h1>Install DocToc</h1>

<p>Assuming you have Node.js installed in your system and therefore the npm command is available run the following command to install the DocToc project.</p>

<pre><code>$ npm install -g doctoc
</code></pre>

<h1>Generating TOC</h1>

<p>Once installed we just need to indicate on which files we are going to generate the TOC. If our project is in github only must execute the following command</p>

<pre><code>$ doctoc README.md
</code></pre>

<p>If our project is hosted in Bitbucket we just need execute the command with a slight variation as shown below.</p>

<pre><code>$ doctoc README.md --bitbucket
</code></pre>

<p>You can see a TOC generated by this command in the project <a href="https://github.com/enzolutions/community-bookstore/">https://github.com/enzolutions/community-bookstore/</a></p>

<p>I hope you have been to his liking.</p>

                <title>Grunt: How to list available tasks</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>In the blog entry <a href="http://enzolutions.com/articles/2014/06/18/introduction-to-grunt/">Introduction to Grunt</a> I  explained how we could use Grunt to automate tasks, but the only way to detect the available tasks is review the Gruntfile.js file or perform the tasks, but it's not be a good idea execute tasks that do not know what they do .</p>

<p>Fortunately there is a plugin that allows  Grunt toe review tasks available, this plugin is <a href="https://github.com/ben-eb/grunt-available-tasks">grunt-available-tasks</a>. Lets see how we can implement it in our  project.</p>

<h1>Install plugin.</h1>

<p>The first thing to do is install the plugin available-tasks running assuming you have npm installed just execute the following command.</p>

<pre><code>$ npm install grunt-available-tasks --save-dev
</code></pre>

<p>The above command will add the respective dependency in your package.json file and you will get a similar entry to the following file.</p>

<pre><code>"grunt-available-tasks":"0.5.0"
</code></pre>

<h1>Add task to Grunt.</h1>

<p>Having as base the file <strong>Gruntfile.js</strong> created in previous entry "Introduction to Grunt" we will include the necessary configuration to add the task to list the available tasks as shown below.</p>

<pre><code>availabletasks: {
  tasks: {
    options: {
      filter: 'exclude',
      tasks: ['availabletasks', 'tasks']
    }
  }              
},
</code></pre>

<p>The above action registers the configuration for the plugin <strong>available-tasks</strong> indicating that we want to exclude from the list of tasks "availabletasks" and "tasks " the last one  is an alias to configure later.</p>

<h1>Load the plugin.</h1>

<p>In order to execute the comand availabletasks/tasks we have load the plugin with the following settings Gruntfile.js close the end of file as shown in the following listing</p>

<pre><code>grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-available-tasks');
</code></pre>

<h1>Register the task.</h1>

<p>Finally lets register the task using an alias to facilitate their implementation, for which we just add the following code at the end of the configuration file.</p>

<pre><code>grunt.registerTask('tasks', ['availabletasks']);
</code></pre>

<h1>Run the command</h1>

<p>At this point we could get the tasks available and should just run the following command.</p>

<pre><code>$ grunt tasks
</code></pre>

<p>The above command would get an output  similar to the following image.</p>

<p><img src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/grunt-tasks.png"/></p>

                <title>Understanding Configuration Management in Drupal 8</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>In few months we will get the new release of Drupal the #8 (I hope) and I think it's time to start to test, learn and write about the new ways we have in Drupal 8 to do our old tricks.</p>

<p>Today I want to talk about the Drupal 8 <a target="_blank" href="http://drupal8cmi.org/">Initiative Configuration Management</a>, this initiative pretend to facilitate the process of pass Site Building stuffs from Dev environments to Production.</p>

<p>As you can imagine this feature will be a replacement of Drupal <a target="_blank" href="https://www.drupal.org/project/features">Features</a> and if you don't use or don't like Features also will be a replacement for Drupal <a target="_blank" href="https://www.drupal.org/project/bundle_copy">Bundle Copy</a></p>

<h1>Installing Drupal 8</h1>

<p>Right now there isn't an official Drupal release for Drupal 8, but if you can start to test you can get directly from git repository.</p>

<p>If you don't have plans to contribute with code to Drupal 8 you can use the following command to get just the latest version of Drupal 8 but without the whole git history reducing dramatically the download process.</p>

<pre><code>git clone -depth 1 --branch 8.0.x http://git.drupal.org/project/drupal.git [FOLDER_NAME]
</code></pre>

<p>After that you just need create a Database and point your webserver to this folder and start the installation in the same way you usually do for Drupal 7.</p>

<h1>Configuration Management Install</h1>

<p>You don't need install Configuration Management module, because is part of Drupal 8 Core and is already installed when you complete a standard Drupal 8 installation, as you can see in the following image.</p>

<p><img src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/configuration_management_module_enable.png"/></p>

<p>As you can imagine, you can't disable the Configuration Management module.</p>

<h1>Export Configuration</h1>

<p>As I said at the beginning Configuration Management is a replacement for Features, so you need to work in your website doing Site Building tasks like creating or modifying content types and other tasks like creating Views(part of Drupal 8 Core).</p>

<p>Now we will call the first Drupal 8 Installation <strong>Devel#1</strong> of a new Drupal 8 project and as you can imagine we need to share our progress with the rest of team and to avoid to create a DB Dump and force the rest of the team import we will use the Configuration Management.</p>

<p>The administrator of <strong>Devel#1</strong> has to go page: example.com/admin/config/development/configuration/full/export the UI will looks similar to image below.</p>

<p><img src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/configuration_management_full_export.png"></p>

<p>After press the button Export you will get a zip file named <strong>config.tar.gz</strong>, after you uncompress the zip file you will get a config folder with severals files in <a target="_blank" href="http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/yaml/yaml_format.html">YAML</a> format and each one represent a isolate piece of configuration of our site. Below you can a partial list of files created by export.</p>

<pre><code>block.block.bartik_footer.yml       menu.entity.node.page.yml
block.block.bartik_help.yml       menu_link.static.overrides.yml
block.block.bartik_login.yml        menu_ui.settings.yml
block.block.bartik_powered.yml        node.settings.yml
block.block.bartik_search.yml       node.type.article.yml
block.block.bartik_tools.yml        node.type.book.yml
block.block.seven_breadcrumbs.yml     node.type.page.yml
block.block.seven_content.yml       rdf.mapping.comment.comment.yml
block.block.seven_help.yml        rdf.mapping.node.article.yml
</code></pre>

<p>Now we have the options to share all files or just one of them with the rest of the team.</p>

<h1>Importing Configuration</h1>

<p>Now we have the files required to import the configuration in other Drupal installation <strong>Devel#2</strong> but we need to prepare the destination.</p>

<p>The Drupal 8 installation process create two folders to handle the import and export process, the installer create two folders inside <DOCROOT>/sites/default/files using random names, but we can check the proper names checking our configuration at <DOCROOT>/sites/default/setting.php.</p>

<p>Let me show you an example of that configuration file:</p>

<pre><code>$settings['install_profile'] = 'standard';
$config_directories['active'] = 'sites/default/files/config_0HU-CmGmyKok3uG6Ao8Lv4WCsVZDwqitSKnQcUNPJmtrKWdgQuM4nhQNZO_T5Mcsmaz-bFcOyA/active';
$config_directories['staging'] = 'sites/default/files/config_0HU-CmGmyKok3uG6Ao8Lv4WCsVZDwqitSKnQcUNPJmtrKWdgQuM4nhQNZO_T5Mcsmaz-bFcOyA/staging';
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see now we have two concepts <strong>active</strong> and <strong>staging</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>active</strong> folder must contain the current site configuration, but by default is empty because the default storage for current site is Database but is possible change I will write about that in other blog entry.</p>

<p>The <strong>staging</strong> folder contain any configuration we want to import in our site, here we must copy the files we get from export process.</p>

<p>I recommend use a version system like GIT to control the staging files and change configuration to use a non hash folder name, check my recommendation below:</p>

<pre><code>$settings['install_profile'] = 'standard';
$config_directories['active'] = 'sites/default/files/config_rK_6KVDPn-s9l-ea_L0XBN1GzJlcnrZ3CssUXn1eQ7G98viRJXesYsSdsf_KjxkCRgelximKzg/active';
$config_directories['staging'] = 'sites/default/config/staging';
</code></pre>

<p>Is required your web server have permissions to read the configuration files, for instance if _www is the user running your web server you must run the following commands:</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo chown -R _www sites/default/config/staging/
$ sudo chmod -R 755 sites/default/config/staging/
</code></pre>

<p>Until here all looks OK, but If you go to the page example.com/admin/config/development/configuration you will get the following error</p>

<p><img src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/configuration_management_sync_error.png"/></p>

<p>We will solve this issue in next section.</p>

<h2>Force Site UUID match</h2>

<p>The Configuration Management only allow sync configuration between same site or project to avoid issues importing configuration from site a.com to b.com, to accomplish this validation Drupal 8 generate a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.drupal.org/project/uuid">UUID</a> for each site.</p>

<p>You cat get your current site UUDI executing the following command</p>

<pre><code>$ drush cget system.site
</code></pre>

<p>The command above we will have a similar output to next listing</p>

<pre><code>uuid: 236fa77c-d83e-42de-8a03-03c574c00160
name: backend.com
mail: enzo@enzolutions.com
slogan: ''
page:
  403: ''
  404: ''
  front: node
admin_compact_mode: false
weight_select_max: 100
langcode: en
</code></pre>

<p>The config import has a different UUID, you can confirm the UID with the following command</p>

<pre><code>$ cat sites/default/config/staging/system.site.yml
</code></pre>

<p>For that reason uou need to change the value of Site UUID using the following Drush command:</p>

<pre><code>$ drush cedit system.site
</code></pre>

<p>The command above enable you to use your favorite text editor to set the same UUID present in staging config files.</p>

<h2>Run Sync</h2>

<p>After change the UUID and change the permissions, if you visit again the page example.com/admin/config/development/configuration you will see all changes, deletions, renames, and additions as you can see in the following image:</p>

<p><img src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/configuration_management_sync.png"/></p>

<p>You can review the differences and remove some files from staging folder if you are not happy with the result and finally execute the Import All process.</p>

<p>If you are a Drush lover you still can run this process with Drush with the following command:</p>

<pre><code>$ drush config-import staging
</code></pre>

<p>After complete the import you have now site sync.</p>

<p>I hope you have found this article useful.</p>

                <title>How to create an interactive command in Node.js</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>One of the first things we learn in a new programming language is how to  implement a command line is to read the parameters provided by user in execution, today I want to make my first blog related to <a target="_blank" href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> and I will show you how to make an interactive interface with Node.js.</p>

<p>For those who are unfamiliar with the concept of interactive interfaces may refer to popular <a target="_blank" href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses">NCurses</a> used in <a target="_blank" href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU/Linux">GNU/Linux</a> platforms.</p>

<h1>Install Inquirer plugin.</h1>

<p>Assuming you already installed Node.js we will use npm command to install the plugin inquirer to provide us an easy way to creating an interface.</p>

<pre><code>$ npm install inquirer
</code></pre>

<h1>Create interactive script</h1>

<p>With the Inquirer plugin installed, we need to create a script called interactivo.js in which we will create our script.</p>

<p>The first thing to do is load the library inquirer as shown below.</p>

<pre><code>var inquirer = require("inquirer");
</code></pre>

<p>To use Inquirer we just pass an array of objects with questions and an anonymous function that will process the responses received, let me show an example the format of implementation.</p>

<pre><code>inquirer.prompt([/* Pass your questions in here */], function( answers ) {
    // Use user feedback for... whatever!!
});
</code></pre>

<p>Now let's see the types of questions that we can build.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>

<p>Input type questions are simple questions that can have a default value and the response is stored in a variable equal to the name that is provided in the configuration, see the implementation.</p>

<pre><code>{
  type: 'input',
  name: 'nombre',
  message: 'Nombre Completo?',
  default: 'Jose Perez'
},
</code></pre>

<h2>Confirm</h2>

<p>The confirm questions are of the type Yes or NO let's see an example of its implementation.</p>

<pre><code>{ type: 'confirm',
  name: 'casado',
  message: 'Casado?',
},
</code></pre>

<h1>List</h1>

<p>The list questions allows you to select your answer from a list of predefined options, as shown below.</p>

<pre><code>{
  type: "list",
  name: "estudios",
  message: "Nivel academico?",
  choices: [
    "Primaria",
    "Secundaria",
    new inquirer.Separator(),
    "Bachillerato",
    "Licenciatura",
    "Doctorado"
   ]
},
</code></pre>

<p>This type of question allows placing a separator of options as is seen in the above list.</p>

<h1>Checkbox</h1>

<p>The checkbox questions type allows the user to check a list of options which apply in his case, as shown in the following code listing.</p>

<pre><code>{
  type: "checkbox",
  message: "Servicios Publicos",
  name: "servicios",
  choices: [
    {
      name: "Agua",
      checked: true
    },
    {
      name: "Luz"
    },
    {
      name: "Internet"
    },
    ],
}
</code></pre>

<h1>Password</h1>

<p>The password questions type as its name suggest use a mask to hide what the user is typing on the screen, let's see an example.</p>

<pre><code>{
  type: "password",
  message: "Enter your git password",
  name: "password"
}
</code></pre>

<p>Let's now look full implementation.</p>

<pre><code>var inquirer = require("inquirer");
 
var preguntas = [
    {
      type: 'input',
      name: 'nombre',
      message: 'Nombre Completo?',
      default: 'Jose Perez'
    },
    { type: 'confirm',
      name: 'casado',
      message: 'Casado?',
    },
    { when: function (response) {
        return response.casado;
      },
      type: 'input',
      name: 'hijos',
      message: 'Número de hijos?',
    },
    {
    type: "list",
    name: "estudios",
    message: "Nivel academico?",
    choices: [
      "Primaria",
      "Secundaria",
      new inquirer.Separator(),
      "Bachillerato",
      "Licenciatura",
      "Doctorado"
     ]
    },
    {
    type: "checkbox",
    message: "Servicios Publicos",
    name: "servicios",
    choices: [
      {
        name: "Agua",
        checked: true
      },
      {
        name: "Luz"
      },
      {
        name: "Internet"
      },
      ],
    }
    ];
inquirer.prompt(preguntas, function(respuestas) {
  console.log(respuestas);
});
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see what I did was create an array with objects with the definitions of the types of questions outlined above and this arrangement is passed to inquirer.prompt function and as the second parameter an anonymous function is pass to prints the user's responses.</p>

<p>Within the definition of the questions the script add a bonus which is the use of when tproperty. When is a property that allows us to validate if we show or not a question validating the previous answers as shown below.</p>

<pre><code>when: function (response) {
  return response.casado;
}
</code></pre>

<h1>Execute the script.</h1>

<p>To run the newly created script we just run the following command line.</p>

<pre><code>$ node interactivo.js
</code></pre>

<p>Depending on user responses the result will be different, but similar to the following image.</p>

<p><img src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/nodejs_interactive.png"/></p>

                <title>How to enable CORS requests against Drupal 8</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<h1>The Problem</h1>

<p>Nowadays I was creating a new version of my library <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/enzolutions/backbone.drupal">https://github.com/enzolutions/backbone.drupal</a> to enable to use Drupal 8 in mode <strong>Headless Drupal</strong> using front end in a different domain or subdomain.</p>

<p>The problem I found with <a href="http://enzolutions.com/articles/2014/05/31/what-is-cross-origin-resource-sharing-cors/">CORS</a> requests is related with the way jQuery execute the first request Ajax, because before to do an execution of a GET|PUT|DELETE|POST|PATCH request an <a target="_blank" href="http://restpatterns.org/HTTP_Methods/OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a> request is executed to validate request methods accepted for backend server more information at <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/">http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/</a> in <strong>contentType</strong> section.</p>

<p>The current status of Rest module (part of Drupal Core) doesn't implement the OPTIONS method, so my first approach was implement that method in class <strong>Drupal\rest\Plugin\rest\resource\EntityResource</strong> using the following code</p>

<pre><code>public function options(EntityInterface $entity) {
   $response = new ResourceResponse();
   $response-&gt;setStatusCode(ResourceResponse::HTTP_OK);
   $response-&gt;headers-&gt;set('Allow', 'GET,POST,PATCH,DELETE,OPTIONS');
   return $response-&gt;send();
  }
</code></pre>

<p>After add that extra function in class <strong>EntityResource</strong> the method was available and double checked with module <a target="_blank" href="https://www.drupal.org/project/restui">RestUI</a>, but this solution wasn't enough because I can't enable OPTIONS method without authentication and jQuery trigger the OPTIONS method without CRC Token or Basic Auth method even if you provide in the original call.</p>

<h1>The Solution</h1>

<p>In order to resolve the problem I use .htaccess and Apache <a target="_blank" href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_rewrite.html">mod_rewrite</a> to enable CORS and intercept the OPTIONS request to avoid Drupal reject the request because doesn't have the proper credentials, I did a patch for Drupal 8 and you can download the patch <a target="_blank" href="https://www.drupal.org/files/issues/core-cors-headers-1869548-26.patch">here</a>.</p>

<p>But let me explain the changes introduced in my patch.</p>

<h2>Intercept OPTIONS Request</h2>

<p>I add a Mod Rewrite Condition and Rule to avoid all OPTIONS request be processed by Drupal and rejected, instead of a <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#2xx_Success">HTTP 200 OK</a> code is returned in order to enable jQuery request continue with the normal workflow.</p>

<p>Check the code below.</p>

<pre><code>RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} OPTIONS
RewriteRule .* / [R=200,L]
</code></pre>

<h2>Enable CORS</h2>

<p>If you search how to enable CORS using .htaccess you will find tons of similar information and this information usually works, but in our case we have a special situation the intercept process we implemented above.</p>

<p>Because the interception the normal statements to enable CORS doesn't work and apache will reject our request, to resolve this problem I found the condition <a target="_blank" href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_headers.html">always</a> for Header directive.</p>

<p>Check the implementation below.</p>

<pre><code>Header always set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"
Header always set Access-Control-Allow-Methods "POST, GET, OPTIONS, PATCH, DELETE"
Header always set Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Authorization
</code></pre>

<p>I strongly recommend to change <strong>*</strong> for your frontend domain i.e frontend-example.com.</p>

<p>I expect you have found this entry useful.</p>

                <title>How to pass parameters to RequireJS modules</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>RequireJS is a great library for managing JavaScript dependencies and create JavaScript modules to encapsulate concepts in your application. If you are totally new with RequiteJS maybe you want to read the post entry <a target='_blank' href="http://enzolutions.com//articles/2014/06/01/what-is-and-how-it-works-requirejs/">What is and how it works RequireJS</a>.</p>

<h1>The Problem</h1>

<p>With <a target='_blank' href="http://requirejs.org/">RequireJS</a> you can encapsulate concepts to re use in other areas of your Front End application.</p>

<p>Let me show you an example of a RequireJS module.</p>

<pre><code>define([
  'backbone.marionette',
  'communicator'
],
function (Marionette, Communicator) {
    'use strict';

    var RegionManager = Marionette.Controller.extend({

      initialize: function (options) {
        console.log('Initialize a Region Manager');

        /* internal region manager */
        this._regionManager = new Marionette.RegionManager();

        /* event API */
        Communicator.reqres.setHandler('RM:addRegion', this.addRegion, this);
        Communicator.reqres.setHandler('RM:removeRegion', this.removeRegion, this);
        Communicator.reqres.setHandler('RM:getRegion', this.getRegion, this);
      },

      /* add region facade */
      addRegion: function (regionName, regionId) {
        var region = this.getRegion(regionName);

        if (region) {
          console.log('REGION ALREADY CREATED TO JUST RETURN REF');
          return region;
        }

        return this._regionManager.addRegion(regionName, regionId);
      },

      /* remove region facade */
      removeRegion: function (regionName) {
        this._regionManager.removeRegion(regionName);
      },

      /* get region facade */
      getRegion: function (regionName) {
        return this._regionManager.get(regionName);
      }
    });

    return RegionManager;
  });
</code></pre>

<p>To use this module in other module you have to load the module as you can see below</p>

<pre><code>define([
  'backbone.marionette','regionManager'],
   function (Marionette, RegionManager) {
  'use strict';

  var regionManager = new RegionManager();

});
</code></pre>

<p>The problem with previous implementación is you can't send parameter to <em>RegionManager</em> module to use in the creación of RegionManager instance.</p>

<h1>The Solution</h1>

<p>To resolve this issue we need to do an implementation of patter design <a target='_blank' href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection">Dependency injection</a>.</p>

<p>Now do this implementation of Dependency injection, let me change a little bit how a Module is created adding a function to object returned as you can see in the following implementation.</p>

<pre><code>define(function(){
    return {
        init: function(Router){
          Router.appRoute('', 'home');
          Router.appRoute('login', 'login');
        }
    };
});
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see in the above code the init function receive and object <em>Router</em> and we use this object to add two Routes.</p>

<p>Now let me show you how the module Routes is call from other module.</p>

<pre><code>define([
  'backbone.marionette','router','routes'],
   function (Marionette, Router, Routes) {

    // Create Router instance.
    this._router = new Router({ App: this});

    // Set routes in router using dependency injection.
    Routes.init(this._router);
});
</code></pre>

<p>Also you can use this kind of function in module to set a local variable to be used later for other internal functions.</p>

<p>I hope you found this blog entry useful.</p>

                <title>Manage PHP versions with Phpbrew.</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p><img style="float:left; margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/phpbrew.png"/> If you are a PHP developer I'm sure you have been in a situation where you have to maintain several projects and is possible some of them require different version of PHP.</p>

<p>To resolve this situation described above nowadays the common recommendation is install a virtual machine like <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/" target="_blank">Vagrant</a> or <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker</a> and off course works but if you are not a big fan of <em>Virtual Machines</em> like me and specially to only change the PHP version I have good news you can resolve your problems using the project <a href="http://phpbrew.github.io/phpbrew/" target="_blank">Phpbrew</a>.</p>

<p>Let me show you how to install and use.</p>

<h1>Install Phpbrew.</h1>

<h2>Dependencies.</h2>

<p>If you already have an environment to dev in PHP is probable you can skip this section.</p>

<p>The following utils are required.</p>

<ul>
<li>automake</li>
<li>autoconf</li>
<li>curl</li>
<li>pcre</li>
<li>re2c</li>
<li>mhash</li>

<li>mcrypt</li>
<li>gmp</li>
<li>libevent</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are in Mac OS X and you use <a href="http://brew.sh/" target="_blank">brew</a> you run the following command.</p>

<pre><code>$ brew install automake autoconf curl pcre re2c mhash libtool icu4c gettext jpeg libxml2 mcrypt gmp libevent
$ brew link icu4c
</code></pre>

<h2>Download, Install and Initialize.</h2>

<p>To install you just need to execute the following commands</p>

<pre><code>$ curl -L -O https://github.com/phpbrew/phpbrew/raw/master/phpbrew
$ chmod +x phpbrew
$ sudo mv phpbrew /usr/bin/phpbrew
</code></pre>

<p>Now you must initialize your system executing the following command.</p>

<pre><code>$ phpbrew init
</code></pre>

<p>Then add these lines to your <em>.bashrc</em>, <em>.bash_profile</em> or <em>.zshrc</em> file</p>

<pre><code>export PHPBREW_SET_PROMPT=1
source ~/.phpbrew/bashrc
</code></pre>

<h1>Phpbrew commands</h1>

<h2>List PHP versions available to be installed</h2>

<pre><code>$ phpbrew known
5.6:  5.6.1, 5.6.0 ...
5.5:  5.5.17, 5.5.16, 5.5.15, 5.5.14, 5.5.13, 5.5.12, 5.5.11, 5.5.10 ...
5.4:  5.4.33, 5.4.32, 5.4.31, 5.4.30, 5.4.29, 5.4.28, 5.4.27, 5.4.26 ...
5.3:  5.3.29, 5.3.28, 5.3.27, 5.3.26, 5.3.25, 5.3.24, 5.3.23, 5.3.22 ...
</code></pre>

<h2>Install a PHP specific version of PHP</h2>

<pre><code>$ phpbrew install 5.5.10
</code></pre>

<p>You need wait until Phpbrew configure your system.</p>

<h2>Install a PHP with specific libraries or virtual variant.</h2>

<pre><code>$ sudo phpbrew install 5.5.10 +mysql +pdo +ctype +mhash +hash +iconv +json +iconv +gd +apxs2=/usr/sbin/apxs -- --with-gd --enable-gd-natf --with-jpeg-dir --with-png-dir

$ sudo phpbrew install 5.5.10 +default +mysql +hash +iconv +gd +apxs2=/usr/sbin/apxs -- --with-gd --enable-gd-natf --with-jpeg-dir --with-png-dir
</code></pre>

<p>If you don't know where is located the directory for your apache <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/programs/apxs.html">apxs</a> you can execute the following command.</p>

<pre><code>$ whereis apxs
/usr/sbin/apxs
</code></pre>

<p>The previous install works to use with <a href="http://drupal.org" target="_blank">Drupal</a> 8 and <a href="spress.yosymfony.com" target="_blank">Spress</a>.</p>

<h2>Get a list of available libraries or variants</h2>

<pre><code>$ phpbrew variants
Variants:
  all, apxs2, bcmath, bz2, calendar, cgi, cli, ctype, curl, dba, debug, dom,
  embed, exif, fileinfo, filter, fpm, ftp, gcov, gd, gettext, hash, iconv,

  pcntl, pcre, pdo, pgsql, phar, phpdbg, posix, readline, session, soap,
  sockets, sqlite, static, tidy, tokenizer, wddx, xml, xml_all, xmlrpc,
  zip, zlib


Virtual variants:
  dbs: sqlite, mysql, pgsql, pdo
  mb: mbstring, mbregex
  neutral:
  default: bcmath, bz2, calendar, cli, ctype, dom, fileinfo, filter, ipc,
  json, mbregex, mbstring, mhash, mcrypt, pcntl, pcre, pdo, phar, posix,
  readline, sockets, tokenizer, xml, curl, zip


Using variants to build PHP:

  phpbrew install php-5.3.10 +default
  phpbrew install php-5.3.10 +mysql +pdo
  phpbrew install php-5.3.10 +mysql +pdo +apxs2
  phpbrew install php-5.3.10 +mysql +pdo +apxs2=/usr/bin/apxs2
</code></pre>

<h2>List php version versions available in your system</h2>

<pre><code>$ phpbrew list
Installed versions:
* php-5.5.10
</code></pre>

<h2>Change php Version</h2>

<pre><code>$ phpbrew switch php-5.5.10
</code></pre>

<h2>Disable Phpbrew</h2>

<pre><code>$ phpbrew off
phpbrew is turned off.
</code></pre>

<p>After disable Phpbrew you can execute the following command to check the current status of system</p>

<pre><code>$ phpbrew list
Installed versions:
* (system)
  php-5.5.10
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see the PHP version available if the normal PHP version your system have, off course you enable again other version using the <em>switch</em> command explained above.</p>

<h1>Enable PHPbrew version in Apache.</h1>

<p>After switch a version you must to inform to apache about the new version of PHP apache editing the apache config file <em>/etc/apache2/httpd.conf</em> or <em>/private/etc/apache2/httpd.conf</em> as you can see in the follow snippet.</p>

<pre><code>#LoadModule php5_module libexec/apache2/libphp5.so #Disabled
LoadModule hfs_apple_module libexec/apache2/mod_hfs_apple.so
LoadModule php5_module libexec/apache2/libphp5.5.10.so
</code></pre>

<p>As you can imagine a restart of Apache Server is required.</p>

<h2>Update Phpbrew</h2>

<pre><code>$ phpbrew self-update
</code></pre>

<h1>Modify your PHP info.</h1>

<p>Is so probable after enable a new version of PHP you lost your previous setup and you need to apply that tweaks and tricks in your new PHP.ini to determine where are located you just need execute the next command.</p>

<pre><code>$ phpbrew info | grep php.ini
Loaded Configuration File =&gt; ~/.phpbrew/php/php-5.5.10/etc/php.ini
</code></pre>

<p>Remove the grep portion to get the whole information.</p>

                <title>Apache issues after upgrade to Mac OS X Yosemite.</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p><img style="float:left; margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/mac_osx_yosemite.png"/> Last night I had the <em>brilliant</em> idea of upgrade to latest version of Mac OS X <a href="http://www.apple.com/osx/" target="_blank">Yosemite</a> and the upgrade process itself was slow as usual but without any apparent error.</p>

<p>The problems popup when I decide continue the development of <a href="https://github.com/enzolutions/generator-marionette-drupal" target="_blank">Yeoman Marionette Drupal generator</a> against Drupal 8.</p>

<p>When I try to use my regular installation of Drupal 8 I got the infamous message <em>"It Works!"</em>, so the upgrade screw my apache configuration.</p>

<p>After executing the following command I detect my system now has <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/">Apache 2.4</a>.</p>

<pre><code>$ httpd -v
Server version: Apache/2.4.9 (Unix)
Server built:   Sep  9 2014 14:48:20
</code></pre>

<h1>Where is my previous configuration</h1>

<p>You can find your old configuration at <em>/etc/apache2/httpd.conf~previous</em>, but could a bad idea just restore because some directives could be wrong.</p>

<p>Instead of I start to re-enable the things I used to have enabled.</p>

<h2>Mod Rewrite</h2>

<p>Because I'm a Drupal developer this is a mandatory Apache module, to re-enabled you just need edit the file <em>/etc/apache2/httpd.conf</em> and enable the following line</p>

<pre><code>LoadModule rewrite_module libexec/apache2/mod_rewrite.so
</code></pre>

<h2>Virtual Hosts</h2>

<p>If you used to have virtual host for your different project this feature is gone, again you just need to enable the directive to load where are located your virtual host as you can see in the following snippet.</p>

<pre><code># Virtual hosts
Include /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf
</code></pre>

<h3>Client denied by server configuration</h3>

<p>After enable your virtual hosts is probable you can't access your sites and if you check your error log you will get an error similar to following log.</p>

<pre><code>[Sun Oct 19 10:29:31.338082 2014] [authz_core:error] [pid 3008] [client 127.0.0.1:51587] AH01630: client denied by server configuration: /Users/enzo/www/drupal8/
</code></pre>

<p>After read some document I found I have to add to my <em>Directory</em> section of Virtual Host the directive <em>Require all granted</em>, after apply my Virtual Host looks like next definition.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
    ServerAdmin enzo@enzolutions.com
    DocumentRoot "/Users/enzo/www/drupal8"

    ServerName drupal8

    #ServerAlias www.dummy-host.example.com
    &lt;Directory /Users/enzo/www/drupal8&gt;
        Require all granted
        Options Includes FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride All
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
    &lt;/Directory&gt;

    ErrorLog "/private/var/log/apache2/drupal8-error.log"
    CustomLog "/private/var/log/apache2/drupal8-access.log" common
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>After this changes is probable your PHP version require some tweaks, in this case I recommend read the blog entry "<a href="http://enzolutions.com/articles/2014/10/17/manage-php-versions-with-phpbrew">Manage PHP versions with Phpbrew</a>".</p>

                <title>How to validate Bower files.</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p><img style="float:left; margin-right: 20px;;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/bower-logo.png"/> If we want to enable people to use our libraries via <a href="bower.io" target="_blank">Bower</a> we need to follow some simple steps.</p>

<ul>
<li>Add a bower.json files to our project.</li>
<li>Create a release matching the info in our bower file.</li>
<li>Run <em>bower register</em> command to share our project.</li>
</ul>

<h1>The Problem</h1>

<p>The problem I found is the publishing process don't validate the bower.json, so is probable after publish when people try to use your library even if the system detect the library is available they get an awful error like this</p>

<pre><code>bower backform#~0.0.1-alpha EMALFORMED Failed to read /var/folders/bh/8fr0bx9113n0plkjjkt2s5d40000gn/T/enzo/bower/backform-20375-ST4wT6/bower.json

Additional error details:
Unexpected token n
</code></pre>

<h1>The solution.</h1>

<p>Fortunately there is a Node.js package to validate the bower.json before to publish.</p>

<p>We need to install the package with the following command.</p>

<pre><code>$ npm install bower-json
</code></pre>

<p>Execute this command inside the folder of your library or use the option <em>-g</em> to install globally is up to you.</p>

<p>Now we will use the following Node.js scrit to validate the bower.json file, let name this script as <strong>check_bower.js</strong></p>

<pre><code>var bowerJson = require('bower-json');

// Can also be used by simply calling bowerJson()
bowerJson.read('./bower.json', function (err, json) {
    if (err) {
        console.error('There was an error reading the file');
        console.error(err.message);
        return;
    }

    console.log('JSON: ', json);
});
</code></pre>

<p>To use this script execute the following command.</p>

<pre><code>$ node check_bower.js
</code></pre>

<p>As you can imagine you will get the same error in the first execution, so you need to work in your file until you get an output similar to this</p>

<pre><code>JSON:  { name: 'backform',
  main: [ 'src/backform.js' ],
  version: '0.0.1-alpha',
  homepage: 'https://github.com/AmiliaApp/backform',
  author: { name: 'Martin Drapeau', email: 'martindrapeau@gmail.com' },
  description: 'Backform takes a Backbone model and transforms it into an HTML form',
  keywords: [ 'backbone', 'form', 'underscore' ],
  license: 'MIT',
  ignore: [ '**/.*', 'node_modules', 'bower_components', 'test', 'tests' ],
  dependencies: { backbone: '1.0.0 - 1.1.2', underscore: '1.4.4 - 1.6.0' } }
</code></pre>

<p>You can see a bower file sample at <a href="https://github.com/enzolutions/backbone.drupal/blob/master/bower.json" target="_blank">https://github.com/enzolutions/backbone.drupal/blob/master/bower.json</a>.</p>

<p>Last but not least important use the <a href="http://bower.io/docs/creating-packages">documentation</a> about what elements must be used in a a bower.json to be valid.</p>

<h1>Readers Contribution</h1>

<p>One of my readers <a href="https://disqus.com/by/jhabdas/">Josh Habdas</a> recommend also the tool <a href="http://package-json-validator.com/">Package.json validator</a> to validate before to send.</p>

<p>I hope you found this blog entry useful.</p>

                <title>How to work with Drupal 8 forms with Ajax.</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>Nowadays Drupal 8 has couple of beta releases so the official release is around the corner. For that reason I start to test the typical features required in a Drupal 7 site.</p>

<p>Today I will share with you my experiences with Form with Ajax effects.</p>

<h1>Create a Form</h1>

<p>I will skip the explanation about how to create a Form in Drupal 8 because could be generated using the project <a href="http://drupalconsole.com/" target="_blank">Drupal Console</a> executing the following command.</p>

<pre><code>$ php console.phar generate:form:config
</code></pre>

<h1>Drupal 8 FAPI + Ajax</h1>

<p>The current documentation of FAPI for Drupal 8 about <a href="https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/developer!topics!forms_api_reference.html/8#ajax" target="_blank">ajax</a> is not updated.</p>

<p>But the property is still name <strong>#ajax</strong> check the following implementation.</p>

<pre><code>   $form['source']['version'] = array(
      '#type' =&gt; 'radios',
      '#title' =&gt; $this-&gt;t('Drupal Version'),
      '#default_value'=&gt;"d6",
      '#options' =&gt; $options,
      '#description' =&gt; t('Choise what version of Drupal you want migrate'),
      '#required' =&gt; TRUE,
      '#ajax' =&gt; array(
        'callback' =&gt; '::updateDestinationIds',
        'wrapper' =&gt; 'edit-destinations',
        'progress' =&gt; array(
          'type' =&gt; 'throbber',
          'message' =&gt; "searching",
        ),
      ),
    );
</code></pre>

<p>If you are a old developer of Drupal you will recognize the properties <strong>wrapper</strong>, <strong>progress</strong>, these properties work equal in Drupal 7.</p>

<p>The main change is in callback property, in my example the value '::updateDestinationIds' means the method <em>updateDestinationIds</em> is part of the Form class. I didn't test but looks like we can assign a static method like 'Drupal::StaticMethod'.</p>

<h1>Response method</h1>

<p>Similar to Drupal 7 the method has to return the portion of the Form must be overwritten via ajax, let me show you an example.</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * Gets migration configurations.
 *
 * @return array
 *   An array of migration names.
 */
function updateDestinationIds($form, FormStateInterface $form_state) {
    $form ['source']['migration_ids']['#options'] = $this-&gt;getDestinationIds($form_state-&gt;getValue('version'));
    return $form ['source']['migration_ids'];
}
</code></pre>

<h1>Known Issues</h1>

<p>After implement the Ajax function I detect a problem when I try to select values populated via Ajax and submit the form I get this error message "An illegal choice has been detected. Please contact the site administrator."</p>

<p>When I debug I can determine the method <a href="https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core!lib!Drupal!Core!Installer!Form!SiteSettingsForm.php/function/SiteSettingsForm%3A%3AbuildForm/8" target="_blank">buildForm</a> is executed in different moments listed below</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Form load</strong>: To build the form</li>
<li><strong>Ajax request</strong>: To re-build the form and determine elements to overwrite.</li>
<li><strong>Form submit</strong>: To process the form</li>
</ul>

<p>My problem was in the last one <em>Form Submit</em> because the submit run the implementation of class <a href="https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21lib%21Drupal%21Core%21Form%21FormValidator.php/8" target="_blank">FormValidator</a>.</p>

<p>The FormValidator ignore the Ajax process and validate the FormState values against the list of values allowed and because took this values from buildForm they are always the initial values ignoring the user interaction.</p>

<p>To resolve this problem I use the  <a href="https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21lib%21Drupal%21Core%21Form%21FormState.php/class/FormState/8" target="_blank">FormState</a> object to determine if buildForm was executed to render the form at first time or if has human interaction (ajax or submit) to define the allowed list of values based in user interaction, check the following snippet.</p>

<pre><code>$form_state_complete_form=$form_state-&gt;getCompleteForm();
if(empty($form_state_complete_version)){
    $form ['source']['migration_ids']['#options'] = $this-&gt;getDestinationIds("d6");
 }
  else  {
   $form ['source']['migration_ids']['#options'] = $this-&gt;getDestinationIds($form_state_complete_version);
 }
</code></pre>

<p>Don't be worry about this behavior as you can see is easy to fix and I'm sure won't be necessary when Drupal 8 get the first official release.</p>

<h1>Caveats</h1>

<p>The current status of Drupal 8 only support the ajax update in <em>Select</em> elements, I tried with <strong>tableselect</strong> and <strong>checkboxes</strong> and doesn't work.</p>

<p>There is an issue for this problem at <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/1458824" target="_blank">Ajax doesn't work with Tableselect with checkboxes</a>.</p>

                <title>Resetting the administrator password with sql-query in Drupal 8</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<h1>The Problem</h1>

<p>When in Drupal 8, the password for user #1 (the administrator) is lost and the email notification don't work, it is possible to set the password via a database query.</p>

<p>Right now we are in the middle of the development of Drupal 8 and the usual command <a href="http://www.drushcommands.com/drush-6x/user/user-login" target="_blank"><strong>drush uli</strong></a> provided by <a href="http://www.drush.org/" target="_blank"></a>Drush doesn't work.</p>

<p>Right now when I try to execute that command I got the following error.</p>

<pre><code>Fatal error: Call to undefined function url() in /Users/enzo/.composer/vendor/drush/drush/commands/user/user.drush.inc on line 466
Drush command terminated abnormally due to an unrecoverable error.
</code></pre>

<h1>The Solution</h1>

<h2>Generate a new password</h2>

<p>First, you have to generate a password hash that is valid for your site.</p>

<p>Execute the following commands from the command line, in the Drupal 8 root directory:</p>

<pre><code>$ php core/scripts/password-hash.sh 'your-new-pass-here'

password: your-new-pass-here    hash: $S$EV4QAYSIc9XNZD9GMNDwMpMJXPJzz1J2dkSH6KIGiAVXvREBy.9E
</code></pre>

<p>Be careful not to include more or less characters as the hash. These hashes look somewhat like <strong>$S$EV4QAYSIc9XNZD9GMNDwMpMJXPJzz1J2dkSH6KIGiAVXvREBy.9E</strong>.</p>

<p>We will use the generated password later.</p>

<h2>Update the user password.</h2>

<p>Now you need to update the user password, in our case we need update the Administrator password, fortunately the UID for Administrator is 1 equal to previous versions of Drupal.</p>

<p>With the new password we need run the following SQL statement.</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE users_field_data SET pass='$S$E5j59pCS9kjQ8P/M1aUCKuF4UUIp.dXjrHyvnE4PerAVJ93bIu4U' WHERE uid = 1;
</code></pre>

<h2>Dealing with Cache</h2>

<p>At this point if you try to login in the Drupal 8 website you will rejected, it's because the login system don't read directly the table <strong>users_field_data</strong> instead of a cache for entities is used.</p>

<p>To flush the cache for a specific user entity with compromise the rest of cache of your system you can use the following SQL statement.</p>

<pre><code>DELETE FROM cache_entity WHERE cid = 'values:user:1';
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can grab a cup of coffee/tea and enjoy your Drupal 8 website.</p>

<p>I hope you found this article useful.</p>

                <title>How to create a Field Formatter in Drupal 8</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>One of the biggest changes in <a href="https://www.drupal.org/drupal-8.0" target="_blank">Drupal 8</a> is his integration with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer" target="_blank">RESTful</a>.</p>

<p>Because now Views lives in Core you can create a view with JSON response in few minutes, you just need enable modules <strong>Views</strong>, <strong>Views UI</strong> and <strong>RESTful Web Services</strong></p>

<p>The problem I found with image is the formatter for image is not compatible with RESTful responses due the output of Image formatter is HTML.</p>

<h1>Create a View</h1>

<p>Let me explain the situation if you create a view with a <strong>Rest Export</strong> display you can select what fields of your entity you want to render.</p>

<p>Now if you choose an image field the default format is Image as you can see in the following snapshot.</p>

<p><img src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/image_field_formatter.png"/></p>

<p>Even if you don't set the option to link to original image you will get the image in HTML format as you see in the following sample of JSON response.</p>

<pre><code>[
  {
    title: "Image sample # 3",
    field_image: " &lt;img src="http://example.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/field/image/globe.jpg?itok=wmu3VCr6" width="100" height="75" alt="" typeof="foaf:Image" class="image-style-thumbnail" /&gt; "
  },

  },

<p>The previous output was generated by a view selecting articles with images, if you want import this view in your system just download the file <a href="http://enzolutions.com/assets/attaches/view_image_list.yml" target="_blank">views_list.yml</a> and import using the Configuration Management of Drupal accessing the URL <strong>http://example.com/admin/config/development/configuration/single/import</strong> in your Drupal install as you can see in the following image.</p>

<p>If you want read more about Configuration Management in Drupal 8 you can read the post entry <a href="{site.url}}/articles/2014/08/27/understanding-configuration-management-in-drupal-8/">Understanding Configuration Management in Drupal 8</a></p>

<p>To resolve this problem I will show you how to create your own Field Formatter to meet your needs.</p>

<h1>Create a Module</h1>

<p>I will skip the explanation about how to create a Module in Drupal 8 because could be generated using the project <a href="http://drupalconsole.com/" target="_blank">Drupal Console</a> executing the following command.</p>

<pre><code>$ php console.phar generate:module
</code></pre>

<h1>Create a new Field Formatter</h1>

<p>If you want to create a new custom Field Formatter is require to add a new class file located inside your module in the following path</p>

<pre><code>YOUR_MODULE/src/Plugin/Field/FieldFormatter/
</code></pre>

<p>Inside this folder you must create a class file per each Field Formatter do you want to create.</p>

<p>I will create a new file named <strong>ImageRawFormatter.php</strong>, I will explain each part of this file</p>

<h2>Field Formatter Metadata</h2>

<p>Before to start to code we must to define some stuff required for a proper function.</p>

<h3>Namespace</h3>

<p>We have to define what will be Namespace for your Field Formatter</p>

<pre><code>namespace Drupal\image_raw_formatter\Plugin\Field\FieldFormatter;
</code></pre>

<p>Drupal 8 implement <a href="http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/" target="_blank">PSR-4</a> from  <a href="http://www.php-fig.org/" target="_blank">PHP Framework Interop Group</a></p>

<p>This specification follow the following pattern</p>

<pre><code>\&lt;NamespaceName&gt;(\&lt;SubNamespaceNames&gt;)*\&lt;ClassName&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In our case the division will be</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>NamespaceName</strong>: Drupal</li>
<li><strong>SubNamespaceNames</strong>: image_raw_formatter\Plugin\Field\FieldFormatter</li>
<li><strong>ClassName</strong>: ImageRawFormatter</li>
</ul>

<h2>Libraries required</h2>

<p>In this specific case we have to define where are classes we require to create our Field Formatter.</p>

<p>Drupal 8 use Autoloader class but we need to inform where they are using the intruction <strong>use</strong>.</p>

<pre><code>use Drupal\image\Plugin\Field\FieldFormatter\ImageFormatterBase;
use Drupal\image\Entity\ImageStyle;
use Drupal\Core\Form\FormStateInterface;
use Drupal\Core\Field\FieldItemListInterface;
use \InvalidArgumentException;
</code></pre>

<h3>Annotations</h3>

<p>Drupal 8 have several discovers to detect specific implementation, for instance we have a Discover to detect all Field Formatter declared in our application and the way to declare a new Field Formatter is using <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/annotations" target="_blank">Annotations</a>.</p>

<p>Below you can find an annotation example for Field Formatter</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * Plugin implementation of the 'image_raw_formatter' formatter.
 *
 * @FieldFormatter(
 *   id = "image_raw_formatter",
 *   label = @Translation("Image Raw"),
 *   field_types = {
 *     "image"
 *   }
 * )
 */
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see we must define an unique <strong>id</strong> with a <strong>label</strong> with translation and we must define for which field types this Field Formatter will be available.</p>

<h2>Implement Class</h2>

<p>Now we have to create a class extending from <a href="https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21modules%21image%21src%21Plugin%21Field%21FieldFormatter%21ImageFormatterBase.php/class/ImageFormatterBase/8">ImageFormatterBase</a> as you can see in the following snippet</p>

<pre><code>class ImageRawFormatter extends ImageFormatterBase
{
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Settings Form</h3>

<p>Now we have to add a method <strong>settingsForm</strong> to define the Setting options for our Formatter. check the following implementation.</p>

<pre><code>/**
   * {@inheritdoc}
   */
  public function settingsForm(array $form, FormStateInterface $form_state) {
    $image_styles = image_style_options(FALSE);
    $element['image_style'] = array(
      '#title' =&gt; t('Image style'),
      '#type' =&gt; 'select',
      '#default_value' =&gt; $this-&gt;getSetting('image_style'),
      '#empty_option' =&gt; t('None (original image)'),
      '#options' =&gt; $image_styles,
    );
    return $element;
  }
</code></pre>

<p>The implementation above allow user select a specific image style to be returned or just return the original image.</p>

<h3>Summary Report</h3>

<p>Is important to inform to end users current setting of formatter, to enable that we have to implement the method <strong>settingsSummary</strong></p>

<pre><code>/**
   * {@inheritdoc}
   */
  public function settingsSummary() {
    $summary = array();
    $image_styles = image_style_options(FALSE);
    // Unset possible 'No defined styles' option.
    unset($image_styles['']);
    // Styles could be lost because of enabled/disabled modules that defines
    // their styles in code.
    $image_style_setting = $this-&gt;getSetting('image_style');
    if (isset($image_styles[$image_style_setting])) {
      $summary[] = t('Image style: @style', array('@style' =&gt; $image_styles[$image_style_setting]));
    }
    else {
      $summary[] = t('Original image');
    }
    return $summary;
  }
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see the method above just read the current settings and render an output.</p>

<h3>Render Field Formatter</h3>

<p>At the end we need to define the how we want to render the field based in current Field Formatter settings, we have to implement the method <strong>viewElements</strong> as you can see in the following snippet.</p>

<pre><code>/**
   * {@inheritdoc}
   */
  public function viewElements(FieldItemListInterface $items) {
    $elements = array();
    $image_style_setting = $this-&gt;getSetting('image_style');

    // Determine if Image style is required.
    $image_style = NULL;
    if (!empty($image_style_setting)) {
      $image_style = entity_load('image_style', $image_style_setting);
    }
    foreach ($items as $delta =&gt; $item) {
      if ($item-&gt;entity) {
        $image_uri = $item-&gt;entity-&gt;getFileUri();
        // Get image style URL
        if ($image_style) {
          $image_uri = ImageStyle::load($image_style-&gt;getName())-&gt;buildUrl($image_uri);
        } else {
          // Get absolute path for original image
          $image_uri = $item-&gt;entity-&gt;url();
        }
        $elements[$delta] = array(
          '#markup' =&gt; $image_uri,
        );
      }
    }
    return $elements;
  }
</code></pre>

<p>If you read the logic only determine if the configuration require use any image style or if is only required the original image, in both sceneries the proper path url is return.</p>

<p>We don't need any transformation to JSON because that is handled by view Display selected.</p>

<h1>Module usage</h1>

<p>After enable our custom module we just need edit our view and edit the field to use new Raw Formatter as you can see in the following image.</p>

<p><img src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/image_field_raw_formatter.png"/></p>

<p>After save the view and run again the output will be totally different and perfect to use in RESTful services to avoid HTML parsing to extract the image path. check the output example below.</p>

<pre><code>[
  {
    title: "Image sample # 3",
    field_image: "http://drupal8b3.dev/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/field/image/globe.jpg?itok=wmu3VCr6"
  },
  {
    title: "Image sample # 2",
    field_image: "http://drupal8b3.dev/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/field/image/sample_08.jpg?itok=X9N005N1"
  },
  {
    title: "Image sample # 1",
    field_image: "http://drupal8b3.dev/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/field/image/sample_01.jpg?itok=UD1-QXTj"
  }
]
</code></pre>

<p>You can download a full implementation of this custom Image Raw Field Formatter at <a href="https://github.com/enzolutions/image_raw_formatter" target="_blank">https://github.com/enzolutions/image_raw_formatter</a>.</p>

                <title>How to create a Rest Resource in Drupal 8</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>One of the biggest changes in <a href="https://www.drupal.org/drupal-8.0" target="_blank">Drupal 8</a> is his integration with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer" target="_blank">RESTful</a>.</p>

<p>Today I want to share with you how to create your own Rest Resources in a custom module to publish your website information using a RESTful API.</p>

<p>I will create a new REST Resource with the objective to get the list of bundle types available for a specific entity.</p>

<h1>Create a Module</h1>

<p>I will skip the explanation about how to create a Module in Drupal 8 because could be generated using the project <a href="http://drupalconsole.com/" target="_blank">Drupal Console</a> executing the following command.</p>

<pre><code>$ php console.phar generate:module
</code></pre>

<h1>Create a new REST Resource</h1>

<p>Assuming we create a new module named <strong>entity_rest_extra</strong> is required to create a class file <strong>EntityBundlesResource.php</strong> inside the module in a folder path <strong>src/Plugin/rest/resource</strong>.</p>

<h2>Namespace</h2>

<p>The namespace for this new Rest Resource will be</p>

<pre><code>namespace Drupal\entity_rest_extra\Plugin\rest\resource;
</code></pre>

<h2>Libraries</h2>

<p>We must to use some dependencies to create the REST Resource, below the full list.</p>

<pre><code>use Drupal\Core\Entity\EntityManagerInterface;
use Drupal\rest\Plugin\ResourceBase;
use Drupal\rest\ResourceResponse;
use Drupal\Core\Session\AccountProxyInterface;
use Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\ContainerInterface;
use Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\Exception\HttpException;
use Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\Exception\NotFoundHttpException;
use Psr\Log\LoggerInterface;
</code></pre>

<h2>Annotations</h2>

<p>To enable the Discover for REST Resources found our new Rest Resource we must to implement the proper information in Annotation. check the following example.</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * Provides a resource to get bundles by entity.
 *
 * @RestResource(
 *   id = "entity_bundles",
 *   label = @Translation("Bundles by entities"),
 *   uri_paths = {
 *     "canonical" = "/bundles/{entity}"
 *   }
 * )
 */
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see we provide a Resource <strong>id</strong> with a <strong>label</strong>, also we define the <strong>canonical</strong> URL for our REST Resource with a parameter named <strong>entity</strong></p>

<p>Using the annotation the Discover for Rest Resources will declare the routing dynamically so we don't need include a <strong>routing.yml</strong> file in our module.</p>

<h2>Implement Class</h2>

<p>Now we have to create a class extending from <a href="https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21modules%21rest%21src%21Plugin%21ResourceBase.php/class/ResourceBase/8" target="_blank">ResourceBase</a> as you can see in the following snippet</p>

<pre><code>class EntityBundlesResource extends ResourceBase {
  /**
   *  A curent user instance.
   *
   * @var \Drupal\Core\Session\AccountProxyInterface
   */
  protected $currentUser;
  /**
   *  A instance of entity manager.
   *
   * @var \Drupal\Core\Entity\EntityManagerInterface
   */
  protected $entityManager;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Our implementation require two properties for <strong>Current User</strong> and <strong>EntityManager</strong>.</p>

<h1>Class Setup</h1>

<p>As you can imagine each class require a constructor and Drupal 8 is not the exception, but Drupal also implement
<a href="http://www.phptherightway.com/pages/Design-Patterns.html" target="_blank">The Factory Pattern</a> to prepare the values to send to constructor.</p>

<p>But is better to explain to you with the following example where we need to send the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2133171" target="_blank">services</a>: <strong>Resource Format</strong>, <strong>Logger</strong>, <strong>Entity manager</strong> and <strong>Current User</strong> to the <strong>constructor</strong></p>

<pre><code>/**
   * {@inheritdoc}
   */
  public static function create(ContainerInterface $container, array $configuration, $plugin_id, $plugin_definition) {
    return new static(
      $configuration,
      $plugin_id,
      $plugin_definition,
      $container-&gt;getParameter('serializer.formats'),
      $container-&gt;get('logger.factory')-&gt;get('rest'),
      $container-&gt;get('entity.manager'),
      $container-&gt;get('current_user')
    );
  }
</code></pre>

<p>Now we need to define the constructor where we are receiving the values from the create method, as you can see below.</p>

<pre><code>/**
  * Constructs a Drupal\rest\Plugin\ResourceBase object.
  *
  * @param array $configuration
  *   A configuration array containing information about the plugin instance.
  * @param string $plugin_id
  *   The plugin_id for the plugin instance.
  * @param mixed $plugin_definition
  *   The plugin implementation definition.
  * @param array $serializer_formats
  *   The available serialization formats.
  * @param \Psr\Log\LoggerInterface $logger
  *   A logger instance.
  */
  public function __construct(
    array $configuration,
    $plugin_id,
    $plugin_definition,
    array $serializer_formats,
    LoggerInterface $logger,
    EntityManagerInterface $entity_manager,
    AccountProxyInterface $current_user) {
    parent::__construct($configuration, $plugin_id, $plugin_definition, $serializer_formats, $logger);

    $this-&gt;entityManager = $entity_manager;
    $this-&gt;currentUser = $current_user;
  }
</code></pre>

<h1>Implement REST method</h1>

<p>Last but not least we have to define the RESTful state we want to implement, in my example I want to implement a GET method to response according the parameters.</p>

<p>Inside the class with have to create a method matching the RESTful state name, so for GET we have to implement a method named <strong>get</strong> as you can see in the following snippet.</p>

<pre><code>  /*
   * Responds to GET requests.
   *
   * Returns a list of bundles for specified entity.
   *
   * @return \Drupal\rest\ResourceResponse
   *   The response containing a list of bundle names.
   *
   * @throws \Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\Exception\HttpException
   */
  public function get($entity = NULL) {
    if ($entity) {
      $permission = 'Administer content types';
      if(!$this-&gt;currentUser-&gt;hasPermission($permission)) {
        throw new AccessDeniedHttpException();
      }
      $bundles_entities = \Drupal::entityManager()-&gt;getStorage($entity .'_type')-&gt;loadMultiple();
      $bundles = array();
      foreach ($bundles_entities as $entity) {
        $bundles[$entity-&gt;id()] = $entity-&gt;label();
      }
      if (!empty($bundles)) {
        return new ResourceResponse($bundles);
      }
      throw new NotFoundHttpException(t('Bundles for entity @entity were not found', array('@entity' =&gt; $entity)));
    }

    throw new HttpException(t('Entity wasn\'t provided'));
  }
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see the method receive as parameter the last value pass to URL.</p>

<p>Also using the <a href="https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21lib%21Drupal%21Core%21Session%21AccountProxyInterface.php/interface/AccountProxyInterface/8" target="_blank">Account Proxy Interface</a> we can determine if Current User has enough rights to get the bundle list.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21lib%21Drupal%21Core%21Entity%21EntityManagerInterface.php/interface/EntityManagerInterface/8" target="_blank">Entity Manager Interface</a> allow us to we get the list of bundles for Entity requested.</p>

<p>After that we prepare an array with the results, these results will be transformed to the proper format requested by the user using the class <a href="https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21modules%21rest%21src%21ResourceResponse.php/class/ResourceResponse/8" target="_blank">ResourceResponse</a>, in our case we will request a json response.</p>

<p>If you want to implement RESTful state POST just add a method <strong>post</strong></p>

<p>You can see a full and functional custom REST Resources at <a href="https://github.com/enzolutions/entity_rest_extra" target="_blank">https://github.com/enzolutions/entity_rest_extra</a></p>

<h1>Using our new Resource</h1>

<p>Using the contrib module <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/restui/git-instructions" target="_blank">Rest UI</a> (I recommend to use the git version until Drupal 8 get a first release) you can enable your custom Rest Resource.</p>

<p>This module enable a UI to set the Authentication and format for each RESTful method implemented as you can see in the following image.</p>

<p><img src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/restui_bundle_entities_settings.png"/></p>

<p>Using this setting the access to Resource will be granted or denied.</p>

<p>Using the Chrome Application <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client/fdmmgilgnpjigdojojpjoooidkmcomcm">Postman - REST Client</a> you can execute an authenticated request to URL <strong>http://example.com/bundles/node</strong> as you can see in the following image.</p>

<p><img src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/postman_rest_request.png"/></p>

<p>If all is working as expected you will get a similar result to next json output.</p>

                <title>A Drupal Guy in a Backbone Conference</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p><img style="float:left; margin-right: 20px;;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/backbonejs_logo.png"/> Past Dic 15th and 16th I attend the 3rd Backbone Conference in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.</p>

<p>I'm a Drupal Backend Developer, so my experience in Front End is limited to small pets projects I have been working just for fun like <a href="http://github.com/enzolutions/generator-marionette-drupal" target="_blank">http://github.com/enzolutions/generator-marionette-drupal</a>.</p>

<p>To be honest Backend Developers speaking generally, we underestimate the work of Front End Developers do.</p>

<p>Even I have been playing with Backbone for last 10 months I didn't have huge expectations about this conference, but eager to get new knowledge. In general I had the idea people will present tons of plugins for instance jQuery plugins.</p>

<p>But I'm glad to say I was totally wrong, after 5 minutes of the first conference I was totally lost between patterns and architecture decision inside the framework.</p>

<p>In general I notice jQuery is a set of tools two generations behind of current implementations.</p>

<p>Also I love how open the community is, because they had conferences talking from Wordpress to competitors like <a href="https://ampersandjs.com/" target="_blank">AmpersanJS</a> and others.</p>

<p>All lectures are available in video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlgxAbM67lYIGw8DnANC7VgREbzJRQged" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>So what is the next for me, well I will try to continue trying to learn more about Front End libraries and frameworks but now I will see with the respect they deserve.</p>

                <title>How to use Drupal 8 state in Cron to resume a process.</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>Usually Cron could be used to execute tasks who require a lot of processing, is normal to execute this tasks over a list of items.</p>

<p>The problem with this requirements is maybe there is not enough with one cron time execution to process the whole elements in our list of items to process. So we have to save the status of our execution to continue the next time the cron is executed.</p>

<p>We can do that with <a href="https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21modules%21system%21core.api.php/group/queue/8" target="_blank">Queue Operations</a>, but this solution is complex to implement(maybe just for me) so I will propose a simple option to implement the resume feature.</p>

<h1>Working with our list of items to process.</h1>

<p>Lets imagine we store our list of items in and array, and the normal option to process and array is using a <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/control-structures.foreach.php" target="_blank">foreach</a>.</p>

<p>Well we can't use a foreach in our resume because this function starts his execution with a reset of the internal array pointer to the first element of the array and that is not good for our resume process.</p>

<p>So I have to use a different solution to do that, let me show you my first implementation</p>

<pre><code>foreach ( $array as $array_key =&gt; $array_value ) {
}
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of that I decide to use a simple while with some changes to simulate the array key assignation in a variable as you can see in the following snippet.</p>

<pre><code>while (list($array_key, $array_value) = each($array)) {
}
</code></pre>

<h1>Store last state</h1>

<p>With the problem about array pointer resolved we need store the last correct pointer processed by cron, to store that I use a new feature of Drupal 8 <a href="https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core!lib!Drupal.php/function/Drupal%3A%3Astate/8" target="_blank">Drupal::state()</a>.</p>

<p>Drupal:state store temporary and not critical information, this information is not be migrated between environments in a eventual migration to production.</p>

<p>Let me show you how to use in combination with while loops</p>

<pre><code>while (list($array_key, $array_value) = each($array)) {

  // --- INSERT LONG OPERATIONS HERE --

  // Set last bank process to continue after this bank
  \Drupal::state()-&gt;set('last_key', $array_key);
}

// Delete last bank if all were processed
\Drupal::state()-&gt;delete('last_key');
</code></pre>

<p>If the hook_cron is interrupted at least we will know in the last index executed without problems, because is stored in state variable <strong>last_key</strong></p>

<p>If we don't get any interruption we must delete the state variable.</p>

<h1>Set array pointer</h1>

<p>First I need to create a custom function named <strong>_array_set_pointer_by_key</strong> to set the array pointer to any arbitrary position, let me show the implementation.</p>

<pre><code>function _array_set_pointer_by_key(&amp;$array, $key)
{
    reset($array);
    while($index=key($array))
    {
        if($index==$key)
            break;

        next($array);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The function above works with any kind of array keys.</p>

<p>Now we need to validate if we have to resume the execution of <strong>hook_cron</strong> in some position of our array of list of items, using again the <strong>Drupal::State</strong> to get the information as you can see in the following piece of code.</p>

<pre><code>$last_key = \Drupal::state()-&gt;get($last_bank_variable, null);

if ($last_key) {
  // Set pointer to last key to process
  _array_set_pointer_by_key($array, $last_key);

  // Set array to next valid bank to process
  next($array);
}
</code></pre>

<p>After reset the array we use the <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.next.php" target="_blank">next</a> function to move the pointer to next position where we want to resume.</p>

<p>I hope you find this blog entry useful.</p>

                <title>How to create an Authentication Provider in Drupal 8</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>Some weeks ago I show you <a href="http://enzolutions.com/articles/2014/12/16/how-to-create-a-rest-resource-in-drupal-8" target="_blank">How to create a Rest Resource in Drupal 8</a> and as I explain in that post we use the Authentication Provider <strong>Basic Auth</strong> as you can see in the following image.</p>

<p><img src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/restui_bundle_entities_settings.png"/></p>

<p>Right now is the unique Authentication Provider available to use in a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS" target="_blank">CORS</a> scenery. If you want to read more about CORS you can read the blog entry <a href="http://enzolutions.com2014/05/31/what-is-cross-origin-resource-sharing-cors" target="_blank">What is Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)</a>.</p>

<p>But what about if <strong>Basic Auth</strong> doesn't fit with your needs, well I will show you how to create a custom Authentication Provider.</p>

<h1>The Requirement</h1>

<p>My imaginary request will be create an Authentication Provider without user validation, that means access as <strong>Anonymous</strong> user, but we require to validate the source of request to check against an <strong>IP White List</strong> enabled to access our REST resources.</p>

<h1>Create a Module</h1>

<p>I will skip the explanation about how to create the Module <strong>ip_consumer_auth</strong> in Drupal 8 because could be generated using the project <a href="http://drupalconsole.com/" target="_blank">Drupal Console</a> executing the following command.</p>

<pre><code>$ drupal generate:module
</code></pre>

<p>After create the module with the console, we will use the console again to create a Form Configuration to create our <strong>IP White List</strong> using the following command.</p>

<pre><code>$ drupal generate:form:config
</code></pre>

<p>Now we must add a Textarea field to the form to store allowed IP Address. The implementation of method buildForm will looks similar to following snippet.</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * {@inheritdoc}
 */
public function buildForm(array $form, FormStateInterface $form_state) {
  $config = $this-&gt;config('ip_consumer_auth.consumers_form_config');
  $form['allowed_ip_consumers'] = [
    '#type' =&gt; 'textarea',
    '#title' =&gt; $this-&gt;t('Allowed IP Consumers'),
    '#description' =&gt; $this-&gt;t('Place IP addresses on separate lines'),
    '#default_value' =&gt; $config-&gt;get('allowed_ip_consumers'),
  ];
  return parent::buildForm($form, $form_state);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The form class will be located at <strong>ip_consumer_auth/src/Form/ConsumersForm.php</strong></p>

<p>The layout to enter allowed IP consumer will looks similar to this image</p>

<p><img src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/allowed_ip_resources.png"/></p>

<p>The code to save that values are generated by <strong>Drupal Console</strong>, in the same way the Routing is created. Be sure you change the values to your convenience after generate the form.</p>

<h1>Create Authentication Provider</h1>

<p>Before to start with code for our Authetication Provider we need to inform to <strong>Drupal 8</strong> the existence of our custom Authentication Provider, to do that we add a new file in our module named <strong>ip_consumer_auth.service.yml</strong> because my module name is <strong>ip_consumer_auth</strong>.</p>

<p>Let me show you the content of that file</p>

<pre><code>services:
  authentication.ip_consumer_auth:
    class: Drupal\ip_consumer_auth\Authentication\Provider\IPConsumerAuth
    arguments: ['@config.factory', '@entity.manager']
    tags:
      - { name: authentication_provider, priority: 100 }
</code></pre>

<p>The discover for services will find this file and registering our Authentication Provider Class <strong>Drupal\ip_consumer_auth\Authentication\Provider\IPConsumerAuth</strong> and prepare the elements to send to constructor.</p>

<p>With the sentence above we don't have to implement the method <strong>create</strong> in our class, because the Discover send the parameters using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection" target="_blank">Dependency Injection</a>.</p>

<p>At the end we define the priority, this value will define the execution order if multiple Authentication Provider were enabled.</p>

<h2>Implement Class Authentication Provider IPConsumerAuth</h2>

<p>Our class <strong>IPConsumerAuth</strong> must implement the interface <a href="https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core!lib!Drupal!Core!Authentication!AuthenticationProviderInterface.php/interface/AuthenticationProviderInterface/8" target="_blank">AuthenticationProviderInterface</a> as you can see in the following snippet.</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * IP Consumer authentication provider.
 */
class IPConsumerAuth implements AuthenticationProviderInterface {
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Libraries</h2>

<p>The Authentication Provider require some libraries and we must to inform to AutoLoader where are these libraries, let me show the complete list.</p>

<pre><code>namespace Drupal\ip_consumer_auth\Authentication\Provider;

use \Drupal\Component\Utility\String;
use Drupal\Core\Authentication\AuthenticationProviderInterface;
use Drupal\Core\Config\ConfigFactoryInterface;
use Drupal\Core\Entity\EntityManagerInterface;
use Drupal\Core\Flood\FloodInterface;
use Drupal\user\UserAuthInterface;
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request;
use Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\Event\GetResponseForExceptionEvent;
use Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\Exception\UnauthorizedHttpException;
use Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\Exception\AccessDeniedHttpException;
</code></pre>

<h2>Implement method applies</h2>

<p>Even if the Authentication Provider is enabled for some REST resource is required a validation to confirm the Authentication Provider apply for current Request.</p>

<p>In our case if our Authentication Provider was enabled we will add any extra validation as you can see in the following implementation.</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * {@inheritdoc}
 */
public function applies(Request $request) {
  // If Authentication Provider is enabled always apply
  return TRUE;
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Implement method authenticate</h2>

<p>Now we have to implement the logic to execute to validate the Request, check the following snippet.</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * {@inheritdoc}
 */
public function authenticate(Request $request) {
  $allowed_ip_consumers = $this-&gt;configFactory-&gt;get('ip_consumer_auth.consumers_form_config')-&gt;get('allowed_ip_consumers');
  $ips = array_map('trim', explode( "\n", $allowed_ip_consumers));
  $consumer_ip = $request-&gt;getClientIp(TRUE);
  if (in_array($consumer_ip, $ips)) {
    // Return Anonymous user
    return $this-&gt;entityManager-&gt;getStorage('user')-&gt;load(0);
  }
  else{
    throw new AccessDeniedHttpException();
    return null;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the implementation above I use the <strong>configFactory</strong> to get the information stored about allowed IP Consumer using the Settings form created before.</p>

<p>The authenticate method receive an <a href="http://api.symfony.com/2.0/Symfony/Component/HttpFoundation/Request.html" target="_blank">Request</a> object defined in <a href="http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/http_foundation/introduction.html"></a>The HttpFoundation Component</a> of <a href="http://symfony.com/" target="_blank">Symfony</a>.</p>

<p>Using the Request method <a href="http://api.symfony.com/2.0/Symfony/Component/HttpFoundation/Request.html#method_getClientIp" target="_blank">getClientIp</a> we get the IP of Consumer.</p>

<p>I used the PHP functions <a href="http://php.net/manual/es/function.explode.php" target="_blank">explode</a>, <a href="http://php.net/manual/es/function.array-map.php" target="_blank">array_map</a> and <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.in-array.php" target="_blank">in_array</a> to determine if IP consumer belong to Allowed IP consumer. I know maybe with a regex will be more efficient but I really sucks in Regex.</p>

<p>If validation pass I return an Account object for Anonymous user, if fail an Access Denied Exception is throw.</p>

<h2>Implement method handleException</h2>

<p>If the IP wasn't in the allowed list of IP Consumer an exception is throw, using the method <strong>handleException</strong> we have the option to intercept and process to produce any output desired.</p>

<p>Let me share with you my implementation</p>

<pre><code>  /**
   * {@inheritdoc}
   */
  public function cleanup(Request $request) {}

  /**
   * {@inheritdoc}
   */
  public function handleException(GetResponseForExceptionEvent $event) {
    $exception = $event-&gt;getException();
    if ($exception instanceof AccessDeniedHttpException) {
      $event-&gt;setException(new UnauthorizedHttpException('Invalid consumer origin.', $exception));
      return TRUE;
    }
    return FALSE;
  }
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see is not to complex, but is just an idea above what you can do with this method.</p>

<h1>Usage</h1>

<p>After create our module with our custom Authentication Provider and enable it, we are ready to start to use.</p>

<p>Lets imagine you install the module <a href="https://github.com/enzolutions/entity_rest_extra" target="_blank">Entity Rest Extra</a> and we will use our Authentication Provider.</p>

<p>Using the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/restui/git-instructions" target="_blank">Rest UI</a>(I recommend to use the git version until Drupal 8 get a first release) module we enable the REST Resource and enable our Custom Authentication Provider, as you can see in the following image.</p>

<p><img src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/custom_authentication_provider.png"/></p>

<h2>Access Denied</h2>

<p>Now if you try to access via CORS the REST end point <strong>http://example.com/bundles/node</strong> you will get an error <strong>403 Forbidden</strong> because the allowed IP consumers weren't defined yet.</p>

<h2>Unauthorized</h2>

<p>After enable your IP consumer and try again <strong>http://example.com/bundles/node</strong> you will get an error <strong>401 Unauthorized</strong></p>

<p>If that error doesn't have any logic for you let me explain, remember in our Authentication Provider we don't have information about any user, so if the request pass the validation of IP Consumer we return an Anonymous user.</p>

<p>When we enable any REST Resource in Drupal 8 a new set of  permissions is created, in our case we have to assign the permission <strong>Access GET on Bundles by entities resource</strong> to Anonymous user as you can see in the following image.</p>

<p><img src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/rest_anonymous_permission.png"/></p>

<h2>Access Denied AGAIN</h2>

<p>Well maybe at this point you get MAD with me, because now you get again an error
 <strong>403 Forbidden</strong>, but at this time the fault is not caused by Authentication Provider or by Rest permission itself.</p>

<p>The error now is related with REST Resource itself is you check the code of module <strong>Entity Rest Extra</strong> you will found the permission <strong>Administer content types</strong> is required to access this Resource.</p>

<h2>Bonus</h2>

<p>Well you can complain about nobody inform to you that module has own permissions validation or the REST permissions, well that could be true.</p>

<p>If you want to get more information about a specific Drupal 8 router you can use the <strong>Drupal Console</strong>.</p>

<p>First thing you have to do is determine the Router id, we can you the canonical URL of REST resource as you can see in the following command.</p>

<pre>
 $ console router:debug | grep bundles/{entity}
 rest.entity_bundles.GET.json                             /bundles/{entity}
 </pre>

<p>Now we can get more information about router using the following command.</p>

<pre>
 $ console router:debug rest.entity_bundles.GET.json
 Route name                   Options
 rest.entity_bundles.GET.json
  + Pattern                   /bundles/{entity}
  + Defaults
   - _controller              Drupal\rest\RequestHandler::handle
   - _plugin                  entity_bundles
  + Options
   - compiler_class           \Drupal\Core\Routing\RouteCompiler
   - _access_mode             ANY
   - 0                        ip_consumer_auth
   - 0                        access_check.permission
  </pre>

<p>As you can see the last thing executed is access_check.permission generating the error 401. Maybe in the future the internal permissions in resourced will be included.</p>

<p>If you want see a complete implementation of Authentication provider you clone the project <a href="https://github.com/enzolutions/ip_consumer_auth" target="_blank">IP Consumer Auth</a></p>

                <title>Backdrop CMS First impressions</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>Today I finally decided to install <a href="https://backdropcms.org/" target="_blank">Backdrop CMS</a> which is in version 1.0 preview and in Jan 15th, 2015.  will see his first official release.</p>

<p>Here I will not compare if is better or not than Drupal 7, I will just report the changes I saw and how complex I found the process to migrate a module from Drupal 7 to <strong>Backdrop</strong></p>

<h1>Installation</h1>

<p>Looks the same as Drupal 8, check the following image and let me know if you're not agree</p>

<p><img src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/installing_backdrop_cms.png"/></p>

<h1>File Structure</h1>

<p>The files structure of Backdrop is so similar to Drupal 8 check in the following image.</p>

<p><img src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/backdrop_file_structure.png"/></p>

<h1>Modules UI</h1>

<p>The modules menu is named now Functionality and as you can see in the following image, the Backdrop CMS core implement a feature implemented by module <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/module_filter" target="_blank">module_filter</a> in Drupal 7.</p>

<p><img src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/backdrop_admin_ui.png"/></p>

<h1>Layouts</h1>

<p>In <strong>example.com/admin/structure/layouts</strong> you can find a new concept <strong>Layouts</strong>, Layouts is an implementation similar to <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/panels" target="_blank">Panels</a> Layouts. By default there are two layouts Admin and Default</p>

<p><img src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/backdrop_layout_ui.png"/></p>

<p>You can create your own Layouts and apply this layouts using a match by URL and/or you can add conditions, as you can see in the following image.</p>

<p><img src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/backdrop_new_layout.png"/></p>

<p>Backdrop doesn't have a menu to get the list of block generated via code, this list of block is only available when edit a Layout and add a block as you can see in the following imagen.</p>

<p><img src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/backdrop_layout_add_block.png"/></p>

<h1>Module Migration</h1>

<p>Well maybe this is the part every buddy was expecting, OK to test I decide to check the list of most used modules in Drupal from <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/usage" target="_blank">Usage</a> project.</p>

<p>I decide to test with <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/token" target="_blank">Token</a> the #4 most used module in Drupal with 746,542 installations reported until Nov 15, 2014.</p>

<p>I skip ctools because off Ctools is too complex and views is already in <strong>Backdrop</strong> core :P</p>

<h2>Enable module in Backdrop</h2>

<p>he structure of Modules in Backdrop is the same as Drupal 7, but we need to apply couple changes to avoid Backdrop report the module was invalid as you can see in the following image.</p>

<p><img src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/backdrop_module_valid_invalid.png"/></p>

<p>The only required change in file token.info is replace core to <strong>backdrop</strong>. Check how token.info must looks the file to be process by Backdrop</p>

<pre><code>name = Token
description = Provides a user interface for the Token API and some missing core tokens.
core = 7.x
files[] = token.test

version = "7.x-1.5"
project = "token"
backdrop = 1.x
</code></pre>

<p>After that the installation process works like a charm, due the hooks hook_requirements, hook_schema and hook_update_xx are supported.</p>

<h2>Changes detected</h2>

<p>As you can imagine there are some things must be change, in order to use the new Backdrop functions.</p>

<p>Caveats I just replace the code reported as PHP Fatal error.</p>

<h3>Replace function system_get_date_types</h3>

<p>The function <a href="https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/modules!system!system.module/function/system_get_date_types/7" target="_blank">system_get_date_types</a> does not exist in Backdrop, but after some reviews in source code of core I detect this function was replaced by <a href="https://api.backdropcms.org/api/backdrop/core%21modules%21system%21system.module/function/system_get_date_formats/1" target="_blank">system_get_date_formats</a>.</p>

<p>Also in Drupal 7 this function return a multidimensional array, and each array entry has a title index, in backdrop this index was replaced by <strong>label</strong></p>

<h3>Replace cache_get and cache_set</h3>

<p>These functions were replaced by function <strong>cache</strong>, this function receive a bin name and return a Cache class with methods set and get.</p>

<p>The default cache class in Backdrop is <a href="https://api.backdropcms.org/api/backdrop/core%21includes%21cache.inc/class/BackdropDatabaseCache/1" target="_blank">BackdropDatabaseCache</a></p>

<p>Let me show how a get change from Drupal 7</p>

<pre><code>Drupal 7: cache_get('field:info', 'cache_token');

Backdrop: cache('token')-&gt;get('field:info');
</code></pre>

<p>Now how a set change from Drupal 7 to Backdrop</p>

<pre><code>Drupal 7: cache_set('field:info', $info, 'cache_token');

Backdrop: cache('token')-&gt;set('field:info', $info);
</code></pre>

<h2>Testing</h2>

<p>After apply this changes in module token I need to test, I decide to create an script and try to execute with Drush, but I got the following error</p>

<pre><code>Fatal error: Call to undefined function node_load() in /Users/enzo/www/backdrop/token_test.php on line 8
</code></pre>

<p>That is because Drush doesn't know how to load the Backdrop bootstrap, so I decide to create a script with the bootstrap included as you can see in the following snippet.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

define('BACKDROP_ROOT', getcwd());

require_once BACKDROP_ROOT . '/core/includes/bootstrap.inc';
backdrop_bootstrap(BACKDROP_BOOTSTRAP_FULL);

$node = node_load(1);

$nid = token_replace('[node:nid]', array('node' =&gt; $node));

print 'Node ID: ' . $nid . "\n";
</code></pre>

<p>The previous script generate the following output.</p>

<pre><code>Node ID: 1
</code></pre>

<p>At least this simple transformation is working, I am not saying the migration process of a module to Backdrop is a piece of cake, but until now looks like is not a titanic project for sure any case is different.</p>

<p>You can check more details about migrate module to Backdrop in video <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by8mMhIpARA">Porting a Module to Backdrop - Basics</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to test my version of Token to Backdrop check the project <a href="https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/token" target="_blank">Backdrop Token</a></p>

                <title>How to overwrite Backbone Model save function</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p><img style="float:left; margin-right: 20px;;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/backbonejs-logo-small.png"/> <a href="http://backbonejs.org" target="_blank">Backbone JS</a> enables you to create a JS application to connect with your existing API over a RESTful JSON interface.</p>

<p>Backbone define some <a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer" target="_blank">REST</a> states to operate over models for instance:</p>

<ul>
<li>Model Fetch: <strong>GET</strong></li>
<li>Model New: <strong>POST</strong></li>
<li>Model Update: <strong>PUT</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>But is possible our API doesn't implement all REST States, for instance <a href="http://www.drupal.org" target="_blank">Drupal</a> 8 (version in development) don't implement the method PUT to save Drupal Entities yet.</p>

<p>In exchange the REST State PATCH is used by Drupal to save models.</p>

<p>So if I try to create a regular Model as you can see in the following snippet.</p>

<pre><code>Node = Backbone.Model.extend({
        initialize: function(){
            alert("Welcome to this world");
        }
    });

var node = new Node({ id: 1, title: 'Node Sample in Backbone'});

node.save(userDetails, {
    success: function (user) {
        alert(user.toJSON());
    }
})
</code></pre>

<p>The code above will execute an Ajax call using PUT method.</p>

<p>If you are a Drupal Developer you will notice the model doesn't match the Drupal Entity structure with language and deltas, but I just want to show a simply logic about Backbone save.</p>

<p>Now let me show you how we can overwrite the save function to change the REST method.</p>

<pre><code>Node = Backbone.Model.extend({
        initialize: function(){
            alert("Welcome to this world");
        },
        save: function(attrs, options) {
          options.patch = true;
          // Proxy the call to the original save function
          Backbone.Model.prototype.save.call(this, attrs, options);
        }
    });

var node = new Node({ id: 1, title: 'Node Sample in Backbone'});

node.save(userDetails, {
    success: function (user) {
        alert(user.toJSON());
    }
})
</code></pre>

<p>Now our model will execute and Ajax request using PATCH method.</p>

<p>I used this technique to enable the library <a href="https://github.com/enzolutions/backbone.drupal" target="_blank">Backbone.Drupal</a> send models to Drupal 8 using REST method PATCH.</p>

<p>I hope you found this blog entry useful.</p>

                <title>How to create a Multi Step Form in Drupal 8</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>Last weekend I organize and participate in the initiative of <a href="http://drupal.org" target="_blank">Drupal</a> Community <a href="http://www.anexusit.com/blog/drupal-sprint-weekend-costa-rica" target="_blank">Global Sprint Weekend</a> with a location in Costa Rica.</p>

<p>Among talks and contributions I found a interesting request in Drupal 8 and I want to share with my the implementation.</p>

<p>I want to create a Multi Step Form, because Drupal 8 doesn't have an official release yet there are many stuff we easily do in Drupal 7 but now in some way to need to learn again how to solve our problems in a different way or Drupal/Symfony Style.</p>

<p>I will create a Multi Step Form to enable users to find a car providing Year, Body Style and Gas Mileage.</p>

<h1>Create a Module</h1>

<p>I will skip the explanation about how to create the Module <strong>multi_step_form</strong> in Drupal 8 because could be generated using the project <a href="http://drupalconsole.com/" target="_blank">Drupal Console</a> executing the following command.</p>

<pre><code>$ drupal generate:module
</code></pre>

<p>After generate the module we will use another command to add a Form with properties required as you can see below</p>

<pre><code>$ drupal generate:form:config
</code></pre>

<p>As result we will get a form with a method <strong>buildForm</strong> like this</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * {@inheritdoc}
 */
public function buildForm(array $form, FormStateInterface $form_state) {

  $config = $this-&gt;config('multi_step.multi_step_form_config');

  $form['model'] = [
    '#type' =&gt; 'select',
    '#title' =&gt; $this-&gt;t('Model'),
    '#description' =&gt; $this-&gt;t(''),
          '#options' =&gt; array('1997', '1998', '1999', '2000', '2001', '2002', '2003', '2004', '2005', '2006', '2007', '2008', '2009', '2010', '2011', '2012', '2013', '2014', '2015'),
          '#default_value' =&gt; $config-&gt;get('model'),
  ];

  $form['body_style'] = [
    '#type' =&gt; 'checkboxes',
    '#title' =&gt; $this-&gt;t('Body Style'),
    '#description' =&gt; $this-&gt;t(''),
          '#options' =&gt; array('Coupe', 'Sedan', 'Convertible', 'Hatchbac', 'Station wagon', 'SUV', 'Minivan', 'Full-size van', 'Pick-up'),
          '#default_value' =&gt; $config-&gt;get('body_style'),
  ];

  $form['gas_mileage'] = [
    '#type' =&gt; 'radios',
    '#title' =&gt; $this-&gt;t('Gas Mileage'),
    '#description' =&gt; $this-&gt;t(''),
          '#options' =&gt; array('20 mpg or less', '21 mpg or more', '26 mpg or more', '31 mpg or more', '36 mpg or more', '41 mpg or more'),
          '#default_value' =&gt; $config-&gt;get('gas_mileage'),
  ];

  return parent::buildForm($form, $form_state);

}
</code></pre>

<h2>Define step property</h2>

<p>Inside the Form class we need to a protected property to store the current step of Multi Step,check the following snippet.</p>

<pre><code>class MultiStepForm extends ConfigFormBase
 {

  protected $step = 1;
</code></pre>

<h2>Get parent form</h2>

<p>Instead of call parent functon <strong>buildForm</strong> at the end I will call at the beginning to modify the form before the form is render.</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * {@inheritdoc}
 */
public function buildForm(array $form, FormStateInterface $form_state) {
  $form = parent::buildForm($form, $form_state);
</code></pre>

<h2>Filter form elements by step</h2>

<p>Now we need filter what elements of form will be rendered based in step value, as you can see in following snippet.</p>

<pre><code>if($this-&gt;step == 1) {
  $form['model'] = [
    '#type' =&gt; 'select',
    '#title' =&gt; $this-&gt;t('Model'),
    '#description' =&gt; $this-&gt;t(''),
          '#options' =&gt; array('1997', '1998', '1999', '2000', '2001', '2002', '2003', '2004', '2005', '2006', '2007', '2008', '2009', '2010', '2011', '2012', '2013', '2014', '2015'),
          '#default_value' =&gt; $config-&gt;get('model'),
  ];
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Change submit label</h2>

<p>Now we need alter the label of submit button to inform end user that there is a next step or if we reach the end of multi step.</p>

<p>In our case we only have 3 steps and the code will be like this</p>

<pre><code>if($this-&gt;step &lt; 3) {
  $button_label = $this-&gt;t('Next');
}
else {
  $button_label = $this-&gt;t('Find a Car');
}

$form['actions']['submit']['#value'] = $button_label;

return $form;
</code></pre>

<h2>Enable Multi Step</h2>

<p>At the end we need enable the Multi Step Form behaviour, to do this is necessary modify the method <strong>submitForm</strong> forcing Form Rebuild if we don't reach yet the last step of Multi Step using the method <a href="https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core!lib!Drupal!Core!Form!FormState.php/function/FormState%3A%3AsetRebuild/8" target="_blank">setRebuild()</a> part of <a href="https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21lib%21Drupal%21Core%21Form%21FormState.php/class/FormState/8" target="_blank">Form State</a>.</p>

<p>The submitForm method will be similar to following code</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * {@inheritdoc}
 */
public function submitForm(array &amp;$form, FormStateInterface $form_state) {
  if($this-&gt;step &lt; 3) {
    $form_state-&gt;setRebuild();
    $this-&gt;step++;
  }
  else {
    parent::submitForm($form, $form_state);
    /*$this-&gt;config('multi_step.multi_step_form_config')
          -&gt;set('model', $form_state-&gt;getValue('model'))
          -&gt;set('body_style', $form_state-&gt;getValue('body_style'))
          -&gt;set('gas_mileage', $form_state-&gt;getValue('gas_mileage'))
        -&gt;save();*/
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you want test a full implementation of Multi Step you can download the module <a href="https://github.com/enzolutions/drupal8_multi_step_form" target="_blank">drupal8_multi_step_form</a>.</p>

<p>I hope you found this blog entry useful.</p>

                <title>What is Drupal Console for me</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p><img style="float:left; margin-right: 20px;;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/drupal_console_logo.png"/> Maybe you hear about the project <a href="http://drupalconsole.com/" target="_blank">Drupal Console</a> or maybe not because is an independent project related with <a href="https://www.drupal.org/drupal-8.0">Drupal 8</a>.</p>

<p>If you are a older Drupal user/developer you could find some similarities with <a href="https://github.com/drush-ops/drush" target="_blank">Drush</a> Project, and to be honest there are some similarities.</p>

<p>But if you are a <a href="http://symfony.com">Symfony</a> developer you will find some similarities with <a href="http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/console/introduction.html" target="_blank">Console Component</a> and actually it's what it is, Drupal Console is an implementation of Symfony Component to meet the Drupal 8 Way.</p>

<p>The Drupal Console, embrace the principles of Drupal 8 about using Symfony 2 components and other libraries to solve the commons problems instead to reinvent the wheel for everything, that concept is called <a href="http://fuseinteractive.ca/blog/im-lazy-here-have-pie" target="_blank">PIE</a> ( Proudly Invented Elsewhere).</p>

<p>Using the Symfony <a href="http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/console/introduction.html" target="_blank">Console Component</a> <a href="http://dmouse.net/">David Flores</a> and <a href="http://jmolivas.com/" target="_blank">Jesus Olivas</a> start a project to implement the same concept from Symfony to Drupal 8.</p>

<p>One of the incentives to create the project Drupal Console was have a pet project to force them to learn the Drupal 8 way.</p>

<p>But now the project is not a pet project anymore, you can see the full list of contributors at <a href="https://github.com/hechoendrupal/DrupalAppConsole/graphs/contributors" target="_blank">https://github.com/hechoendrupal/DrupalAppConsole/graphs/contributors</a> and if you want be part of this project just drop a message using the <a href="https://gitter.im" target="_blank">Gitter</a> room <a href="https://gitter.im/hechoendrupal/DrupalAppConsole">https://gitter.im/hechoendrupal/DrupalAppConsole
</a>.</p>

<p>The majority of commands in Drupal Console require a Drupal 8 instance, because the bootstrap of Drupal 8 is loaded to have access to all classes and libraries used in Drupal 8, to avoid re invent the wheel. But of course you can contribute commands without a dependency of Drupal 8.</p>

<p>Right now the Drupal Console has 28 commands listed below</p>

<pre><code>$ drupal list
Drupal Console version 0.6.5

Available commands:
 cr                              Rebuild and clear all site caches.
 drush                           Run drush from console.
 help                            Displays help for a command
 list                            Lists commands
 self-update                     Update the console to latest version.
cache
 cache:rebuild                   Rebuild and clear all site caches.
config
 config:debug                    Show the current configuration.
container
 container:debug                 Displays current services for an application.
generate
 generate:command                Generate commands for the console.
 generate:controller             Generate &amp; Register a controller
 generate:entity:config          Generate a new "EntityConfig"
 generate:entity:content         Generate a new "EntityContent"
 generate:form:config            Generate a new "ConfigFormBase"
 generate:module                 Generate a module.
 generate:plugin:block           Generate a plugin block
 generate:plugin:imageeffect     Generate image effect plugin.
 generate:plugin:rest:resource   Generate plugin rest resource
 generate:service                Generate service
migrate
 migrate:debug                   Display current migration available for the application
 migrate:execute                 Execute a migration available for application
module
 module:debug                    Display current modules available for application
 module:download                 Install module or modules in the application
 module:install                  Install module or modules in the application
 module:uninstall                Install module or modules in the application
router
 router:debug                    Displays current routes for the application
 router:rebuild                  Rebuild routes for the application
</code></pre>

<p>Most of them are oriented to generate code to speed up the process of development for Drupal 8, but in the same way of Symfony Console has commands to interact with Cache, Migrate and Database you can contribute modules for any purpose, so your imagination is the limit.</p>

<p>In my personal case I'm the contributor of commands related with Drupal 8 Migrate and Modules integration. My inspiration to create these commands wasn't to replace Drush, my ideas was to really understand how the Migration process works and be aware the module activation process.</p>

<p>After complete these commands now I can say I understand how Drupal 8 Migrate process works and how a module is installed and uninstalled.</p>

<p>But the learning process doesn't end in Drupal 8 components, when I try to create the command <a href="https://github.com/enzolutions/DrupalAppConsole/blob/module-command/src/Command/ModuleDownloadCommand.php" target="_blank">module:download</a> I have to declare libraries <a href="https://github.com/alchemy-fr/Zippy" target="_blank">Zippy</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/ARTACK/DOMQuery" target="_blank">DOMQuery</a> as dependencies using <a href="https://getcomposer.org" target="_blank">Composer</a>. Why code that libraries myself if I can use code create for non Drupal Developers :P.</p>

<p>So right now we are looking for testers and coders for new commands to improve the Drupal Console, if you think you can contribute with Drupal Console core you are more than welcome.</p>

<p>Also we expect in the future contribute to Symfony Console Component some code based in our needs, again why create <a href="https://www.acquia.com/blog/building-bridges-linking-islands">island of code</a>, instead of that push back code to the core and help other Open Source projects.</p>

                <title>Running for a position on Drupal Association At Large Director</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>Today I decided to nominate myself as a candidate for a position on <a href="https://assoc.drupal.org/" target="_blank">Drupal Association</a> At <strong>Large Director</strong>.</p>

<p>You can read more about the election process at <a href="https://assoc.drupal.org/blog/holly.ross.drupal/nominations-open-drupal-association-large-director" target="_blank">Nominations Open for Drupal Association At Large Director</a>.</p>

<h1>Important dates</h1>

<ul>
<li>Self Nominations: 1 February,2015 through 20 February, 2015</li>
<li>Elections process: 9 March, 2015 through 20 March, 2015</li>
</ul>

<p>So let me tell you something about my and my motivations to propose my name.</p>

<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Colombian by birth, Costa Rican by choice, I have spent the last 13 years living in that narrow piece of land between North and South America. I co-founded and have been running a successful Drupal workshop called AnexusIT. I am 38, married and father of two brilliant kids: Axel and Zoe. I enjoy long walks through the hallways of Drupal Groups and have a knack for putting together community events.</p>

<p>I got into Drupal 6 in early 2008 after working for many years building websites from scratch using PHP and after many months contributing to a couple of PHP projects with the intention to automate the way websites were built.</p>

<h1>Experience</h1>

<p>My first Drupal project was a real challenge simply because the deadlines were very tight (surprise surprise) and I had no idea how to start working on that thing. I was even the one who had to lead the way and teach others. Anyway, the process was very frustrating but even that the project was delivered with a delay of a few days I ended up hating the project but loving the CMS platform.</p>

<p>My first contact with the community was in 2009 at the 1st Drupal Camp Centroamericano in Nicaragua were I did two lectures and learn a lot about the community and how strong the product could be.</p>

<p>After two years working for other’s companies doing Drupal, I took the decision to start the first Drupal oriented workshop in Costa Rica around 2010. AnexusIT was the first company of it’s kind in Central America. I lead the technological and technical areas of the company. I get to wear many hats but Chief Technology Officer is my official title. My favorite role though, is Drupal developer, where I get to motivate, lead, supervise and encourage my peers while still coding for at least 8 hours every single day.</p>

<p>After the Drupal Camp Centroamericano in Nicaragua I started to organising Drupal Meetups in Costa Rica and building up the Drupal community in Costa Rica. As result, we organised   the 1st Drupal Camp Costa Rica (and 3rd Drupal Camp Centroamericano) in late 2011. We have been hosting this event in Costa Rica yearly with the latest edition being held on August 2014.</p>

<p>During all this time I was leading the community in Costa Rica without an official title, because we were lacking a formal structure. To remediate that, in January 2015, we (the community) founded a NGO called “Drupal Costa Rica” where I am the co-founder and first President. We are planning on using the NGO to facilitate the chores of putting together Drupal activities in Costa Rica.</p>

<h1>Motivation</h1>

<p>In recent years the DA has started looking more world-oriented with the inclusion of members from Europe and Australia, but even that the vision is still through the eyes of people from high develop countries.</p>

<p>After some conversations with a friend from Vietnam <a href="http://de.linkedin.com/in/webtomme/" target="_blank">Tom Soqyu</a> about experiences of activities aimed at building a Drupal community and tasks oriented to create the First Drupal in Vietnam we detect we face similar problems because we live in non developer countries or emerging markets if you want to use other term.</p>

<p>So what ideas I will support in Drupal association, well I love initiatives to sponsor speakers to training people in emergent countries specially if they speak the language of emerging country and french and english in many countries in africa. If I get a position in Drupal Association I will support project in that direction.</p>

<p>So based in my experience of 5 years working with Drupal as Developer, Community Lead and Company Owner in an emergent country I want to bring to DA a different perspective about our challenges and ideas about how to improve the presence of Drupal in Latin America, Africa and Asia.</p>

<h1>Contact me</h1>

<p>Feel free to ask me any question via facebook, twitter, email or using the comments in this post.</p>

<p>So as you can imagine I'm asking you to vote for me. But also I invite you to check all candidates and determine who match better with your mindset and your feeling. Also don't forget to invite your friends to vote.</p>

<h1>Fechas importantes</h1>

<ul>
<li>Auto nominaciones: 1 Feb,2015 a 20 Feb, 2015</li>
<li>Elecciones: 9 Mar, 2015 a 20 Mar, 2015</li>
</ul>

<p>Así que permítanme decirles algo acerca de mi y mis motivaciones para proponer mi nombre.</p>

<h1>Acerca de mi</h1>

<p>Colombian de nacimiento, Costarricense por elección, he pasado los últimos 13 años viviendo en esa estrecha franja de tierra entre Norte y Sur América. Co-fundador de AnexusIT.</p>

<p>Tengo 38 años, casado y padre de dos niños: Axel y Zoe. Disfruto de largos paseos por los pasillos de los Drupal Groups y cierta habilidad para la organizar eventos de la comunidad.</p>

<p>Conocí Drupal 6 a principios de 2008 después de trabajar durante muchos años construyendo sitios web desde cero usando PHP y después de muchos meses de contribuir a un par de proyectos de PHP con la intención de automatizar la forma en sitios web son construidos.</p>

<h1>Experiencia</h1>

<p>Mi primer proyecto Drupal fue un verdadero reto, simplemente porque los plazos eran muy apretados (sorpresa, sorpresa) y no tenía ni idea de cómo empezar a trabajar en en Drupal. Aun así oo era el encargado de liderar el camino y enseñar a otros. Rl proceso fue muy frustrante, pero sin embargo el proyecto fue entregado con un retraso de solo unos días, acabé odiando el proyecto, y amando a la plataforma de CMS.</p>

<p>Mi primer contacto con la comunidad fue en 2009 en la primera Drupal Camp Centroamericano en Nicaragua donde hice dos conferencias y donde aprendí mucho sobre la comunidad y qué tan fuerte es el producto podría ser.</p>

<p>Después de dos años trabajando para empresas haciendo Drupal, tomé la decisión de iniciar la primera totalmente orientada a Drupal Costa Rica alrededor de 2010. AnexusIT fue la primera empresa de su tipo en Centroamérica.</p>

<p>En AnexusIT Dirijo las áreas tecnológicas y técnicas de la empresa. Llego a usar muchos sombreros, aunque el director de tecnología es mi título oficial. Mi papel favorito es el de desarrollador Drupal, donde trato de motivar, liderar, supervisar y animar a mis compañeros de trabajo al mismo tiempo que programar al menos 8 horas cada día.</p>

<p>Después de la Drupal Camp Centroamericano en Nicaragua empecé a organizar Drupal Meetups en Costa Rica y en la edificación de la comunidad Drupal en Costa Rica. Como resultado de ello, organizamos el primera Drupal Camp Costa Rica (y tercera Drupal Camp Centroamericano) a finales de 2011. Hemos sido anfitriones de este evento en Costa Rica cada año donde la última edición se celebro en agosto 2014.</p>

<p>Durante todo este tiempo yo diriji a la comunidad en Costa Rica sin un título oficial, porque nos faltaba una estructura formal. Para remediar esto, en enero de 2015, nosotros (la comunidad) fundamos una ONG llamada "Drupal Costa Rica", donde yo soy el co-fundador y primer presidente. Planeamos usar la ONG para facilitar las tareas de la coordinación de las actividades de Drupal en Costa Rica.</p>

<h1>Motivación.</h1>

<p>En los últimos años la Drupal Association ha empezado a orientarse mas al mundo con la inclusión de los miembros de Europa y Australia, pero aunque la visión ahora es más global es aún la visión de personas de países con un alto nivel de desarrollo.</p>

<p>Después de algunas conversaciones con un amigo de Vietnam <a href="http://de.linkedin.com/in/webtomme/" target="_blank">Tom Soqyu</a> acerca de las experiencias en actividades destinadas a la construcción de una comunidad de Drupal y tareas orientadas a crear el primer Drupal en Vietnam detectamos que a pesar de la distancia nos enfrentamos a problemas similares debido a que vivimos en países no desarrollados o de mercados emergentes si desea utilizar otro término.</p>

<p>Entonces, ¿qué ideas que apoyaré en asociación Drupal, Bueno me encantan iniciativas para patrocinar conferencistas que permitan la formación de personas en los países emergentes, especialmente si hablan el idioma del país emergente como por ejemplo francés y Inglés en muchos países de África. Si obtengo una posición en la Drupal Association voy a apoyar proyectos en esa indole.</p>

<p>Así que basado en mi experiencia de 5 años trabajando con Drupal developer, Líder de una Comunidad y propietario de empresa en un país emergente, quiero llevar a la Drupal Association una perspectiva diferente acerca de nuestros retos e ideas sobre cómo mejorar la presencia de Drupal en América Latina, África y Asia.</p>

<h1>Contácteme</h1>

<p>No dude en hacerme cualquier pregunta a través de Facebook, Twitter, correo electrónico o utilizando los comentarios en está entrada de blog.</p>

<p>Como se puede imaginar le estoy pidiendo que voten por mí. Pero también los invito a comprobar todos los candidatos y determinar cual coincide mejor con su forma de pensar y sentir. También no se olvide de invitar a sus amigos a votar.</p>

                <title>How to enable CORS in Drupal 8 in non Apache webservers</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>As you maybe know <a href="https://www.drupal.org/drupal-8.0">Drupal 8</a> is almost ready to be released, could be in next
<a href="https://events.drupal.org/barcelona2015">DrupalCon Europe</a> held in Barcelona.</p>

<p>However if you are interested in CORS applications you must to wait until Drupal 8.1 to get native support to CORS in Drupal
more information at <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/1869548#comment-9365043">issue</a>.</p>

<p>Long time ago I wrote the article <a href="http://enzolutions.com/articles/2014/09/08/how-to-enable-cors-requests-against-drupal-8/">How to enable CORS requests against Drupal 8</a>
but that approach only works in environments using Apache Web Server, but in servers using a non Apache web server like
 <a href="http://nginx.org/">Ngix</a> that solution is useless. Today I face that problem in <a href="https://pantheon.io">Pantheon</a>.</p>

<p>Therefore, I implemented a solution hacking the file index.php to enable CORS. Let me split the change in two stages.</p>

<p>Firstly we have to guarantee the REST method OPTIONS return the proper value, because Drupal 8 can't handle that request right now, check the code to implement that</p>

<pre><code>  if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] == 'OPTIONS') {
    $response = new Response(200);
    $response-&gt;headers-&gt;set('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*');
    $response-&gt;headers-&gt;set('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'POST, GET, OPTIONS, PATCH, DELETE');
    $response-&gt;headers-&gt;set('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Authorization');
    $response-&gt;send();
    exit;
  }
</code></pre>

<p>Secondly, we have to modify normal requests to enable remote requests from any source desired, as you can see in the following snippet of code</p>

<pre><code>  $response = $kernel
      -&gt;handle($request)
      // Handle the response object.
      -&gt;prepare($request);

  // Enable CORS requests, Change '*' for any specific domain or ip address
  $response-&gt;headers-&gt;set('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*');
  $response-&gt;headers-&gt;set('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'POST, GET, OPTIONS, PATCH, DELETE');
  $response-&gt;headers-&gt;set('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Authorization');
</code></pre>

<p>You can apply this <a href="http://enzolutions.com/assets/attaches/d8-cors-index.patch.txt">patch</a> against Drupal 8 beta 10.</p>

<p>I know there are initiatives to enable this feature using contributed modules, but meanwhile we get a definite solution, 
this is temporary solution flexible enough using Drupal 8 style to start using Drupal as backend in a Decoupled solution.</p>

<p>I hope you found this post useful.</p>

                <title>How to add customs fields to SOLR index using Entity API &amp; Search API</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>Nowadays the ability to search in website almost compulsory and most of the times is took for granted.</p>

<p>Using Drupal we have two main options <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/">SOLR</a> and <a href="https://www.elastic.co/">Elastic Search</a>. 
Today I will explore how to work SOLR server.</p>

<p>In Drupal there are two popular modules to connect it with <strong>SOLR</strong> <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/apachesolr">apachesolr</a> and 
 <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/search_api">search_api</a> and I decided to use <strong>search_api</strong> to interact with SOLR in 
this article.</p>

<h1>The problem</h1>

<p>Lets imagine this problem: We have an Event content type with a Date field to determine the start date and end date (optional).</p>

<p>Using Search API that field could be indexed without mayor problems, but if we try to do a view to list all event in a date range
 is difficult because Views modules doesn't provide the Between operator for SOLR views, this operator is only available
 for views using <strong>Entity Fields</strong></p>

<h1>The Solution</h1>

<p>Because all events have minute granularity we can't use <strong>equal</strong> operator to determine if an event belongs to a specific day, to 
solve that problem we add extra information to SOLR creating two new fields to store the day event in timestamp in order to be 
able to use the equal operator.</p>

<p>To create these new fields in our node entities we will use <a href="http://drupal.org/project/entity">Entity API</a> and more specifically 
hook <a href="http://www.drupalcontrib.org/api/drupal/contributions!entity!entity.api.php/function/hook_entity_property_info_alter/7">hook_entity_property_info_alter</a>.</p>

<p>Let me show you an implementation example.</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * Implements hook_entity_property_info_alter().
 */
function MYMODULE_entity_property_info_alter(&amp;$info) {
  $info['node']['properties']['event_start_day'] = array(
    'type' =&gt; 'integer',
    'label' =&gt; t('Event Start Day'),
    'sanitized' =&gt; TRUE,
    'getter callback' =&gt; 'MYMODULE_search_api_property_event_start_day_getter_callback',
  );
  $info['node']['properties']['event_end_day'] = array(
    'type' =&gt; 'integer',
    'label' =&gt; t('Event End Day'),
    'sanitized' =&gt; TRUE,
    'getter callback' =&gt; 'MYMODULE_search_search_api_property_event_end_day_getter_callback',
  );
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see we are modifying entity definition to include two new properties <strong>event_start_day</strong> and <strong>event_end_day</strong>,
probably the most information is the <strong>getter callback</strong> which is a function used to calculate the proper values for each 
property.</p>

<p>The functions defined in getter callback is used by Search API in the process of indexing to store the value in SOLR index.</p>

<p>Let me show an example of implementation of those getter functions.</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * Getter callback for event start day.
 */
function MYMODULE_search_api_property_event_start_day_getter_callback($item) {
  return strtotime(substr($item-&gt;field_event_date[LANGUAGE_NONE][0]['value'], 0, 10)); 
}

/**
 * Getter callback for event end day.
 */
function MYMODULE_search_search_api_property_event_end_day_getter_callback($item) {
  // Set time at midnight of end day of event
  if($item-&gt;field_event_date[LANGUAGE_NONE][0]['value2'] != '') {
    return strtotime(substr($item-&gt;field_event_date[LANGUAGE_NONE][0]['value2'], 0, 10)) + 86399;
  }
  else {
    return strtotime(substr($item-&gt;field_event_date[LANGUAGE_NONE][0]['value'], 0, 10)) + 86399;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Off course you can implement any logic required here, the variable $item is an object representing a Drupal node.</p>

<p>After clear your cache the new fields will be able to select to be indexed by SOLR, you can do this accessing the URL 
<strong>http://example.com/admin/config/search/search_api/index/YOUR_INDEX/fields</strong> as you can see in the following 
image.</p>

<p><img style="float:left; margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/entity_fields_solr_index_search_api.png"/></p>

<p>When the process of re-index run again the new fields will be stored in SOLR and will be able to be selected in a View.</p>

                <title>How to check php compatibility</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes do you receive the scary mission of validate if your <a href="http://www.php.net">PHP</a> project will continue working if we upgrade or
downgrade the PHP version used in production server.</p>

<p>As you can imagine this is really complex task, because you have determine what pieces of code must to be changed in
order to continue working under new server conditions and any omission could be and would be a huge responsibility above
your shoulders.</p>

<p>Therefore, what you can do? trust in your good judge about code compatibility sounds like a bad approach and indeed it's 
a terrible approach even though if you really believe do you know really well the application.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there are some open source project to enable you to do this check automatically and today I will talk more 
specifically about the project <a href="https://github.com/wimg/PHPCompatibility">PHPCompatibility</a>.</p>

<h1>Install PHP CodeSniffer</h1>

<p>It's possible install PHP CodeSniffer using PEAR, but I would recommend use composer instead of.</p>

<p>Is necessary inform to you system where PHP CodeSniffer binary <strong>phpcs</strong> could found after install with composer using 
the following command.</p>

<pre><code>export PATH=~/.composer/vendor/bin:$PATH
</code></pre>

<p>After that we must execute composer to install PHP CodeSniffer using the following command.</p>

<pre><code>composer global require "squizlabs/php_codesniffer=2.*"
</code></pre>

<p>To check the installation was success we could check running this command. This command will list the installed coding standards.</p>

<pre><code>$ phpcs -i
The installed coding standards are MySource, PEAR, PHPCS, PSR1, PSR2, Squiz and Zend
</code></pre>

<p>Those code standards are located at <strong>~/.composer/vendor/squizlabs/php_codesniffer/CodeSniffer/Standards</strong></p>

<h1>Installing PHPCompatibility code standard.</h1>

<p>To download PHPCompatibility code standard we have to follow these instructions.</p>

<pre><code>$ ~/.composer/vendor/squizlabs/php_codesniffer/CodeSniffer/Standards
$ git clone https://github.com/wimg/PHPCompatibility.git
</code></pre>

<p>Using <strong>phpcs -i</strong> we can double check the new code standard is available to be used.</p>

<pre><code>$ phpcs -i
The installed coding standards are MySource, PEAR, PHPCompatibility, PHPCS, PSR1, PSR2, Squiz and Zend
</code></pre>

<h1>Checking compatibility</h1>

<p>Firstly, you have to define if you a report including errors or warnings or both, in my case I want to exclude warning 
just to focus in fatal error of php I could get after a PHP upgrade in my production server using the following configuration 
for <strong>phpcs</strong>.</p>

<pre><code>phpcs --config-set error_severity 1
phpcs --config-set warning_severity 0
</code></pre>

<h2>Executive report</h2>

<p>If you want to show to your superior an executive report about how will be an upgrade/downgrade of PHP version in your
 application, you can get an overview report using the following command.</p>

<pre><code>$ phpcs --report=source --standard=PHPCompatibility --extensions=php,inc,module,install --runtime-set testVersion 5.5 -pvs .
</code></pre>

<p>The command about analyze all files with extension .php, .inc, .module and .install because and I want to analyze a <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a> 
project, moreover, I want to check the compatibility of this project with PHP 5.5 showing the progress of this analysis.</p>

<p>This command will generate an output similar to following list.</p>

<pre><code>PHP CODE SNIFFER VIOLATION SOURCE SUMMARY
----------------------------------------------------------------------

A TOTAL OF 527 SNIFF VIOLATIONS WERE FOUND IN 4 SOURCES
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Time: 3 mins, 46.3 secs; Memory: 185.25Mb
</code></pre>

<h2>Detailed report</h2>

<p>To evaluate the statement of work to be prepared for the PHP version change, we can get a detail report in a file using 
this command.</p>

<pre><code>phpcs --standard=PHPCompatibility --extensions=php,inc,module,install --report-full=/Users/enzo/Desktop/CS-report.txt --runtime-set testVersion 5.5 -pvs .
</code></pre>

<p>The command above will produce an output similar to this.</p>

<pre><code>FILE: /Users/enzo/drupal/includes/common.inc

                <title>How to customize a Search API filters in Drupal 7</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>Last week I show you <a href="http://enzolutions.com/articles/2015/06/02/how-to-add-customs-fields-to-solr-index-using-entity-api-amp-search-api/">How to add customs fields to SOLR index using Entity API &amp; Search API</a>, 
continues with that line of concept I will to show you how to manipulate a Search API query to include a custom logic in 
your queries.</p>

<p>Firstly, let imagine an hypothetical scenario when we need to run a different query for anonymous and registered users.</p>

<p>Using the custom fields created in previous referenced above we will show today's list of events, in the other hand for 
registered users we will show events in progress (including multi day events) and events coming soon.</p>

<h1>Alter Search API query.</h1>

<p>To modify our queries we will use hook <a href="http://www.drupalcontrib.org/api/drupal/contributions!search_api!search_api.api.php/function/hook_search_api_query_alter/7">hook_search_api_query_alter()</a> 
as you can see in the following example</p>

<pre><code>function MYMODULE_search_api_query_alter(SearchApiQueryInterface $query) {
  global $user;
  // Filter from where the Search API query will be trigger 
  if(arg(0) == 'events' &amp;&amp; arg(1) == 'list') {

    $start_day = strtotime(date('Y-m-d'));

    if($user-&gt;uid == 0 ) {
      $query-&gt;condition('event_start_day', $start_day, '&lt;=');
      $query-&gt;condition('event_end_day', $start_day, '&gt;=');
    }
    else {
      // Select events in progress
      $left_filter = $query-&gt;createFilter('AND');
      $left_filter-&gt;condition('event_start_day', $start_day, '&lt;=');
      $left_filter-&gt;condition('event_end_day', $start_day, '&gt;=');

      // Select events with a start date in the future
      $right_filter = $query-&gt;createFilter('AND');
      $right_filter-&gt;condition('event_start_day', time(), '&gt;=');

      $main_filter = $query-&gt;createFilter('OR');
      $main_filter-&gt;filter($left_filter);
      $main_filter-&gt;filter($right_filter);

      $query-&gt;filter($main_filter);
     }
}     
</code></pre>

<p>Let dissect the previous piece of code. If user is anonymous we will <a href="http://www.drupalcontrib.org/api/drupal/contributions%21search_api%21includes%21query.inc/function/SearchApiQueryInterface%3A%3Acondition/7">SearchApiQueryInterface::condition</a> method 
to include new filters to determine events who are happening today, even though if those events are multi day events.</p>

<p>In the case of registered users, the same method is used but with a subtle variation. By default all conditions are added 
using an <strong>AND</strong> operator which is fine most of the times. However, in our case is required include to groups of validation 
in same query for that reason an <strong>OR</strong> operator is required.</p>

<p>Using the <a href="http://www.drupalcontrib.org/api/drupal/contributions%21search_api%21includes%21query.inc/function/SearchApiQueryInterface%3A%3AcreateFilter/7">SearchApiQueryInterface::createFilter</a> is 
possible create groups of filters using AND or OR operator.</p>

<p>In addition, using <a href="http://www.drupalcontrib.org/api/drupal/contributions%21search_api%21includes%21query.inc/function/SearchApiQueryInterface%3A%3Afilter/7">SearchApiQueryInterface::filter</a> is possible 
include those group of filters inside a <strong>SearchApiQueryInterface</strong> object.</p>

<p>In summary the snippet of code above create a filter similar to</p>

<pre><code>(event_start_day &lt;= time() AND event_end_day &gt;= time()) OR (event_start_day &gt;= time())
</code></pre>

<p>You can create any combination of filters required in your logic.</p>

                <title>How to remove file documents from SOLR index after been replaced in nodes in Drupal 7</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>If you have revisions enabled in your content types, it keeps all your old files on the server (associated with old revisions), 
so replacing a file definitely is harder.</p>

<p>Even though if you don't have revisions enabled, if you try to remove it and add it again to the node, the name/link is 
updated, but since a file with that name is kept on the server and there is a name duplication, Drupal adds those "_0", 
"_1" etc suffixes to future uploaded versions of that file's name.</p>

<p>In term of node render is not a problem, but in terms of SOLR indexing all those files will be indexed, so instead of get 
one record for a match is possible get N records where N is the number of time do you overwrite the same file.</p>

<p>Then, to resolve this annoying behavior I will show you a solution to remove a file document from SOLR index if a file is 
removed from a node. this solution use <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/entity">Entity API</a> module so it should be added 
as a dependency in your module .info file.</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * Implements hook_node_update().
 */
function MYMODULE_node_update($node) {

  // Array of content types to act on.
  if (in_array($node-&gt;type, array('article', 'blog_post'))) {
    $wrapper = entity_metadata_wrapper('node', $node);
    $original_wrapper = entity_metadata_wrapper('node', $node-&gt;original);

    // Array of file fields to act on.
    foreach (array('field_public_files', 'field_private_files') as $field) {
      if (!isset($original_wrapper-&gt;{$field})) {
        continue;
      }
      $current_files = array();
      $original_files = array();

      // Get files that were attached to the original node (before update).
      foreach ($original_wrapper-&gt;{$field}-&gt;value() as $file) {
        $original_files[] = $file['fid'];
      }
      // Stop if there were no files previously attached.
      if (empty($original_files)) {
        continue;
      }

      // Get files currently attached to the node (after update).
      foreach ($wrapper-&gt;{$field}-&gt;value() as $file) {
        $current_files[] = $file['fid'];
      }

      // Delete files that were in the original node but were removed during this update
      $deleted_files = array_diff($original_files, $current_files);
      if(!empty($deleted_files)) {
       $env_id = apachesolr_default_environment();
       $solr = apachesolr_get_solr($env_id);
       foreach ($deleted_files as $fid) {
         $file_id = apachesolr_document_id($fid, 'file') . '-' . $node-&gt;nid;

         // Remove file document from SOLR index, re-index is not required,
         $solr-&gt;deleteByQuery("id:$file_id");
       }
      }
    }
      $deleted_files = array_diff($original_files, $current_files);
      if(!empty($deleted_files)) {

    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The code above react when a node is updated for specific content types and specific fields, using function <a href="http://www.drupalcontrib.org/api/drupal/contributions!entity!entity.module/function/entity_metadata_wrapper/7">entity_metadata_wrapper</a> 
we can determine the information of our node before update and after update.</p>

<p>After calculate if some files were deleted the logic to delete the file document from SOLR is applied, let me see that code 
in detail</p>

<pre><code>$env_id = apachesolr_default_environment();
$solr = apachesolr_get_solr($env_id);
foreach ($deleted_files as $fid) {
 $file_id = apachesolr_document_id($fid, 'file') . '-' . $node-&gt;nid;

 // Remove file document from SOLR index, re-index is not required,
 $solr-&gt;deleteByQuery("id:$file_id");
}
</code></pre>

<p>Firstly, a SOLR object instance is declared. In my example I use the default SOLR instance, if you have more than one instance 
of SOLR is necessary to change the logic to use the proper instance.</p>

<p>Using <a href="http://www.drupalcontrib.org/api/drupal/contributions!apachesolr!apachesolr.module/function/apachesolr_document_id/6">apachesolr_document_id</a> function 
the SOLR ID is calculated using the <strong>fid</strong>, <strong>file</strong> type and providing the specific relation to the specific node subject of 
update, because in some Drupal installs a file could be associated to several nodes.</p>

<p>Finally, using <a href="http://www.drupalcontrib.org/api/drupal/contributions!search_api_solr!includes!solr_connection.interface.inc/function/SearchApiSolrConnectionInterface%3A%3AdeleteByQuery/7">deleteByQuery</a> method the delete from SOLR index is requested, 
this delete is applied immediately, SOLR re-index is not required.</p>

<p>I expect you found this article useful.</p>

                <title>How to merge YAML files</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>By definition, a <a href="http://yaml.org/">YAML</a> is a human-friendly data serialization standard for all programming languages.
But, in a less formal definition YAML is a great format for your configuration files, because, YAML files are as expressive
as XML files and as readable as INI files.</p>

<p>Currently, I am using YAML files for configuration in my <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a>, <a href="http://silex.sensiolabs.org/">Silex</a>
and <a href="http://symfony.com/">Symfony</a> projects. Until now I could say is a good way to save information but I don't have a strong 
preference versus other formats, however, is easy to use, so no regrets.</p>

<p>However, a YAML file could represent anything, let me show you some examples.</p>

<p>The first one from <a href="http://drupalconsole.com">Drupal Console</a> 
project where YAML files are used to store the translations string as you can see for <a href="https://github.com/hechoendrupal/DrupalConsole/blob/master/config/translations/en/application.yml">English</a> and <a href="https://github.com/hechoendrupal/DrupalConsole/blob/master/config/translations/es/application.yml">Spanish</a>. Check
 an extract of translation.</p>

<p>The second one from <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a> where is used by <a href="https://www.drupal.org/drupal-8.0/features#configuration">Configuration Management</a> to export and import configuration across environments. 
Let me show you an example of a basic content type.</p>

<pre><code>uuid: f5c966ac-b9a8-4ab8-b335-5380c6bb8524
name: drupal8.dev
mail: admin@example.com
slogan: ''
page:
  403: ''
  404: ''
  front: /node
admin_compact_mode: false
weight_select_max: 100
langcode: en
default_langcode: en
</code></pre>

<p>Now with all these YAML files surrounded our applications, a new kind of common and challenging tasks appears.</p>

<p>In the case of
Drupal Console project, because the project is in active development; new features and fixes are included constantly in
the code base and their translation are allocated in several YAML files, those files are always quite ahead than their translations, and
try to update without loose current translations is a slow and manual process.</p>

<p>As programmers, we hate manual tasks and in this particular case we always said "If only there be a command or util to do this silly task",
well I did to myself that question and my answer was, include in <strong>Drupal Console</strong> release <a href="https://github.com/hechoendrupal/DrupalConsole/releases/tag/0.7.15">0.7.15</a> a new command
 <strong>yaml:merge</strong></p>

<p>To execute this command, you need at least two YAML files to merge, as you can see in the following batch sentence.</p>

<pre><code>$ drupal yaml:merge new.yml console.en.yml console.es.yml
</code></pre>

<p>What will happen after executing this command is a new file named new.yml containing all <strong>console.en.yml</strong> entries and entries translated in <strong>console.es.yml</strong>, in this way new translations will be maintained and new entries will be included in the new file.</p>

<p>Is possible to set the same file as last parameters and destination to have an immediate overwrite, but a new file is recommended to check the results.</p>

<p>If it's required you can include as many YAML files are required to merge, but, take into account that the YAML files in the right side of command will always overwrite their entries.</p>

<p>The Drupal Console has this kind of problems because there are different sources of contributions and different amount of contributions for language, but 
in the future I can image in Drupal we could have similar kind of requirements when the same piece of configuration is updated in different environment and 
we have the need of merge in one solution.</p>

<p>If you are not a user of <strong>Drupal Console</strong> but you need this command, don't worry if you don't have a Drupal environment, 
Drupal Console is a <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/intro.phar.php">Phar</a> application completely independent of Drupal. To use a command like <strong>yaml:merge</strong>, just install it,
do your job and remove it, if it's not required anymore.</p>

<p>Other commands in Drupal Console related with YAML files are:</p>

<pre><code>yaml:update:value
yaml:update:key
yaml:split
yaml:diff
</code></pre>

                <title>How to download remote files with Silex/Symfony and Drupal 8</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>As a new developer of Silex/Symfony, I found really excited some components available to use with <a href="http://silex.sensiolabs.org/">Silex</a> and <a href="symfony.com">Symfony</a>. Today
I want to talk about <a href="https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle">Guzzle</a> and <a href="https://github.com/alchemy-fr/Zippy">Zippy</a>, I am going to show you how to use both 
to download and handle remote zip/gz files in your application.</p>

<h1>Installing with composer.</h1>

<p>Firstly, we need to add the dependency in our <strong>composer.json</strong> file as you can see in the following snippet.</p>

<pre><code>{
    "require": {
        "guzzlehttp/guzzle": "~6.1.1",
        "alchemy/zippy": "0.2.*@dev"
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>After include these new dependencies you must to run the composer update as you can see in the following bash sentence.</p>

<pre><code>$ composer update
</code></pre>

<h1>Usage</h1>

<p>With those new vendors, you only need to use the, as you can see in the following code.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

use Alchemy\Zippy\Zippy;
use GuzzleHttp\Client;
use Symfony\Component\Filesystem\Filesystem;
use Symfony\Component\Filesystem\Exception\IOExceptionInterface;
</code></pre>

<p>Now inside any method of your class is possible to request to create a client of Guzzle, in general terms Guzzle is like a 
headless browser.</p>

<pre><code>$client =  new Client();

// Destination file to download the release
$destination = tempnam(sys_get_temp_dir(), 'file.') . "tar.gz";

// Get and save file
$client-&gt;get($remote_zip_file_path, ['save_to' =&gt; $destination]);

// Handle Zip file to extract in your system
$zippy = Zippy::load();
$archive = $zippy-&gt;open($destination);
$archive-&gt;extract('./');

try {
  $fs = new Filesystem();
  $fs-&gt;rename($remote_zip_file_name, './' . $new_folder_name);
} catch (IOExceptionInterface $e) {
  print 'Error renaming folder';
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the code above we are assuming we have the path to file and name and we want to rename the folder after extract, the code 
also could be improved include a try catch section for extract process.</p>

<p>As you can see is complex task like that normally is handle by CURL but as you can see Guzzle is more powerful and his implementation is easier to understand.</p>

<h1>Drupal usage.</h1>

<p>Because now <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a> 8 include several Symfony components and other useful components, the code above could be rewrite 
using Drupal 8 wrapper, let me show you the implementation.</p>

<pre><code>use Drupal\Core\Archiver\ArchiveTar;
use Symfony\Component\Filesystem\Filesystem;
use Symfony\Component\Filesystem\Exception\IOExceptionInterface;

</code></pre>

<pre><code>$client =  new Drupal::httpClient();

// Destination file to download the release
$destination = tempnam(sys_get_temp_dir(), 'file.') . "tar.gz";

// Get and save file
$client-&gt;get($remote_zip_file_path, ['save_to' =&gt; $destination]);

// Handle Zip file to extract in your system
$archiver = new ArchiveTar($destination, 'gz');
$archiver-&gt;extract('./');
fclose($destination . '.tar.gz');

try {
  $fs = new Filesystem();
  $fs-&gt;rename($remote_zip_file_name, './' . $new_folder_name);
} catch (IOExceptionInterface $e) {
  print 'Error renaming folder';
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see is similar and we don't have to modify the Drupal 8 composer.json file, to include components because they are
already included in Drupal 8 core.</p>

<p>If you want to check a complete implementation of this logic, you can check the source code of <a href="http://drupalconsole.com">Drupal Console</a> project commands 
<a href="https://github.com/hechoendrupal/DrupalConsole/blob/master/src/Command/Module/DownloadCommand.php">module:download</a> and <a href="https://github.com/hechoendrupal/DrupalConsole/blob/master/src/Command/Site/NewCommand.php">site:new</a></p>

                <title>Why languages are so important in technology?</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>For a long time everybody related technology with the US and more specifically with Silicon Valley, and is normal to have iconic concepts. Now, how that concept affect the penetration of technology around the world? Well, one of the most common commandment for non English speakers is "<strong>You</strong> must learn english if you want to work in this industry".</p>

<p>Personally I partially disagree with that conception, I recognize English is important in IT industry because as a web developer if I could at least read English I got access to the latest news and could be in sync with the trendy topics. But also is true that is possible to work in technology industry without any knowledge of English, if you don't believe me, think about China, India, Japan or Russia they use IT every day and most of them only speak their mother language.</p>

<p>It's probably true that they could receive the latest news in technology a little late, but think about this, humankind is sending astronauts to space using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz">Soyuz</a> a URSS technology from the 70's, so I guess we can survive with a little delay.</p>

<p>Moreover, what I thought is really bad with the concept of only use English as the medium to communicate your products, of course that only applies to products that plans to conquer the world (insert <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Evil">Dr. Evil</a> laugh here).</p>

<p>Let's talk about in terms of <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a> which one of the most important Open Source project around the world. I know you will say, well Drupal right now is translated in some level to <a href="https://localize.drupal.org">110+</a> languages which is again a remarkable achievement, but there is always a but, this is only from end user point of view, what about the documentation necessary for people who pretend to support those multilingual site and without knowledge of English.</p>

<p>Again you can quote again the  commandment for non English speakers is "<strong>You</strong> must learn english if you want to work in this industry" in the sense that if you are or pretending to be a web developer you are suppose to be able to handle some level of English. The problem is using that logic we are automatically excluding the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_total_number_of_speakers">85%</a> of population around the world.</p>

<p>Although, these numbers could be justified in terms that 15% is good enough to attend IT needs of other populations, but remember not all of them are IT guys, that would be so sad.</p>

<p>So, why is it so important to try to attend the needs of non English speakers in Drupal community for web development? Well if you check the numbers of penetration of Drupal in Africa and Asia and in some level in Latin America are almost nothing nothing compared to the numbers in the US/Canada and Europe.</p>

<p>If you are wondering why? The answer is easy, if the locals can't understand the logic behind a product, companies or organisations only have two options A) Hire a really expensive developer overseas B) Find an alternative solution with documentation in their language or at least enough resources in their local market trained to maintain that product.</p>

<p>Then, who is guilty for this situation? Maybe the top notch developers in the US, Canada or Europe, because they don't think in that 85% I mention before, <strong>NO</strong> is not their fault, surprise surprise is our fault, correct you don't misread is our fault, you may not know but I am a Colombian living in Costa Rica, so basically a Latin American by definition and I didn't speak a word of English until 9 years ago, so if you speak &amp; understand English and you have access to that information and you don't produce content in your mother language too, then is your fault.</p>

<p>Basically that top notch developers living in the US/Canada and Europe use the language they know, so is our responsibility to translate or produce IT documentation in our languages Spanish, French, Portuguese, Mandarin, Russian, Hindi etc. By doing this kind of contributions we can introduce a huge and positive impact in our societies because that means that 85% of the population will now have access to the edge of technology and that clever guy that we ignore before will join us to produce a change in our developing societies.</p>

<p>Before you ask yourself, well what are you doing in this direction. I maintain my blog in Spanish too, you can check at <a href="http://7sabores.com/blogs/enzo">7sabores.com</a> and in any project I'm involved I try to include the multilingual component, for instance let me show you how you can translate the project <a href="http://drupalconsole.org">Drupal Console</a>, project I have been investing all my "free time", into your mother language.</p>

<h1>Clone Drupal Console Project</h1>

<p>Go to github repository project <a href="https://github.com/hechoendrupal/DrupalConsole">https://github.com/hechoendrupal/DrupalConsole</a> and hit the button <em>fork</em> on the top of page</p>

<h1>Clone your forked repo</h1>

<pre><code>$ git clione git@github.com:YOURUSERHERE/DrupalConsole.git
</code></pre>

<h1>Add your language translation</h1>

<p>Imagine you want translate Drupal Console to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi">Hindi</a> which is spoken by 250 millions human beings. just follow the following instructions</p>

<pre><code>$ cd DrupalConsoleFolder
$ cp config/translations/console.en.yml config/translations/console.hi.yml
</code></pre>

<p>Now you have a YAML file and you can start to translating string to your mother language.</p>

<h1>Enable DrupalConsole in your language</h1>

<pre><code>$ cd DrupalConsoleFolder
$ ./bin/console init
</code></pre>

<p>The command above generate a config file for Drupal Console located in <strong>~/.console/config.yml</strong>, to enable the new Hindi language, event that language is not part of Drupal Console yet, just change the file and must be locks similar to this snippet.</p>

<pre><code>application:
  environment: 'prod'
  language: hi
  editor: vim
  temp: /tmp
</code></pre>

<h1>Contribute your new language</h1>

<p>You just need to add your language to git and commit to your forked repository github will help you to create a Pull Request, but if you need support for that you can contact us (the maintainers) in our support chat at <a href="https://gitter.im/hechoendrupal/DrupalConsole">https://gitter.im/hechoendrupal/DrupalConsole</a>.</p>

<h1>Sync your changes</h1>

<p>If you are worry because new functionality was added and you are behind, don't worry we added to Drupal Console a command to sync YAML translation files.</p>

<pre><code>$ cd DrupalConsoleFolder
$ ./bin/console yaml:merge console.hi.yml console.en.yml console.hi.yml
</code></pre>

<p>The command above will retain your translation and bring additions to your translation file.</p>

                <title>How to include PHP code in Drupal 8 Views</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>Did you recall the last time you tried to resolve an issue in your program using a small piece of PHP in your views using <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/views_customfield">Views Custom Field</a> in Drupal 6 and  <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/views_php">Views PHP</a> in Drupal 7? Don't lie everybody did that at least once.</p>

<p>Even the fact those are accepted module by the Drupal security team, this solution is really dangerous because execute code using PHP function <a href="http://php.net/manual/es/function.eval.php">eval</a>, execute PHP code loaded from DB it's really bad in terms of security and stability.</p>

<p>Moreover, if someone is auditing your code, this one is the first bad practice the auditor will try to find in your code and you will get a nice recommendation that you must create your own view field handler to do that logic, in order to improve the quality of your code. But to be honest, I did that in the past and even I did that several times, I always found this process really hard.</p>

<p>Nowadays the Drupal community is excited about the release of the first official release of <a href="https://www.drupal.org/news/drupal-8.0.0-released">Drupal 8</a>, so I thought it's time to start with the classical posts about how to do our old practices in this new thing. Today I will share with you how to avoid the usage of Views PHP modules and be able to include PHP in your views but still pass the audit of your code :P.</p>

<p>In this post, I will use the project <a href="http://drupalconsole.com">Drupal Console</a> to facilitate my job.</p>

<h1>1. Create a Drupal 8 module.</h1>

<p>To generate a module you have two options, the first one is using the interactive mode, where the application will ask you all options available in the command. Use the following command to execute the interactive mode, check the following image to see a classical execution.</p>

<pre><code>$ drupal generate:module
</code></pre>

<p><img src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/console_generate_module.png"/></p>

<p>The second option executes the command but passing all options inline as you can see below.</p>

<pre><code>$ drupal generate:module --module="No Views PHP" --machine-name=no_views_php --module-path=/modules/custom --description="Custom views field to include PHP logic in views." --core=8.x --package=Other
</code></pre>

<h1>2. Generate a custom views field</h1>

<p>Views are now in core of Drupal 8, and everything change. As I said before "Drupal 8 is just a new project with same name and logic". So if you knew something about views, well that is not too much useful in terms of code, but the logic, in general remains.</p>

<p>In Drupal 8 views, everything is handled via Plugins and fields are not the exception, if you need to create a custom field you must generate a custom views plugin field. Fortunately, I did a generator in <strong>Drupal Console</strong> for this task, check the following command to generate a views plugin field.</p>

<pre><code>$ drupal generate:plugin:views:field --module=no_views_php --class=PHPViewsField --title="PHP Field" --description="Enable to include and run PHP code in your modules as part of a view"
</code></pre>

<p>The command above will generate the following files:</p>

<pre><code>Site path: /Users/enzo/www/drupal8-rc1
1 - modules/custom/no_views_php/no_views_php.views.inc
2 - modules/custom/no_views_php/src/Plugin//views/field/PHPViewsField.php
</code></pre>

<h1>3. Install your module.</h1>

<p>Now we need to install our generated module with the following command.</p>

<pre><code>$ drupal module:install no_views_php
</code></pre>

<p>Now if you edit the Frontpage view at <strong>http://example.com/admin/structure/views/view/frontpage</strong> you can use the custom field generated after change the mode from show <em>content</em> to show <em>fields</em> as you can see in the following image.</p>

<p><img src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/views_custom_plugin.png"/></p>

<p>Pro tip: If you don't see your generated field, try executing <strong>$ drupal cache:rebuild all</strong> again :P</p>

<p>After applying the minimum configuration to the field, you will get a view preview similar to this image:</p>

<p><img src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/view_frontpage_preview.png"/></p>

<p>The view plugin field generated, by default, return a random string just to show that it's working. Now you have to do your magic in your custom module.</p>

<h1>4. Implementing your logic</h1>

<p>In order to implement your custom logic you have to edit the generated file <strong>modules/custom/no_views_php/src/Plugin//views/field/PHPViewsField.php</strong> and more specific inside the method <strong>render</strong>, this method receives an object of <a href="https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core!modules!views!src!ResultRow.php/class/ResultRow/8">Drupal\views\ResultRow</a> as a parameter.</p>

<p>The default method generated looks like next snippet.</p>

<pre><code>public function render(ResultRow $values) {
  // Return a random text, here you can include your custom logic.
    // Include any namespace required to call the method required to generte the
    // output desired
    $random = new Random();
    return $random-&gt;name();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now I will change the logic to use the title field in row to print it reversed, as you can check in the following code.</p>

<pre><code>public function render(ResultRow $values) {
    // Return a random text, here you can include your custom logic.
    // Include any namespace required to call the method required to generte the
    // output desired
    $title = strip_tags($this-&gt;view-&gt;field['title']-&gt;original_value);
    return strrev($title);
}
</code></pre>

<p>As a result now our field will look different, check the following image.</p>

<p><img src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/view_frontpage_preview2.png"/></p>

<p>As you can see this another silly implementation of a custom PHP, but now you can include in this class any service required to do your magic and transform each row in a view using other row fields as input.</p>

<p>Even better you can include in your code a handler to throw an exception if is required, so your code could as complex and professional as you want.</p>

<p>If you are wondering why don't contribute this as a replacement of Views PHP in Drupal 8, well I thought due we have a Drupal Console generator for that, it's not necessary. Inside Drupal Console project is the eternal discussion about what things must be a generator and what others must be contributed modules.</p>

<p>Some of them became in both a generator and Drupal 8 modules, check out the following list</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/entity_rest_extra">Entity Rest Extra</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/ip_consumer_auth">IP Consumer Auth</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/image_raw_formatter">Image Raw Formatter</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I hope you found this blog post useful.</p>

                <title>Understanding migrations in Drupal 8</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>As you know Drupal 8 was released at Nov 19 / 2015 (finally).</p>

<p>One of the most recurrent questions is <strong>"It's time to create new projects in Drupal 8"</strong>, but there is another difficult question. <strong>"How I can migrate my current Drupal 7/6/* to Drupal 8"</strong></p>

<p>To try to answer that question let me explain a little bit how Migration works in Drupal 8.</p>

<h1>Modules required</h1>

<p>Drupal 8 provide in their core modules the <strong>Migrate</strong> module, this module provide a mini framework to be user to migrate from <em>Any source</em> to Drupal 8. I said ANY because this module itself doesn't have any logic related to Drupal stuff.</p>

<p>The idea is if you plan to migrate from a specific source like Drupal, Wordpress, CQ5 etc you must write an integration to handle the transformation of content into Drupal 8 structure.</p>

<p>Fortunately for us at least we have a Drupal 8 core module related to Drupal named <strong>Migrate Drupal</strong>, this module contains some Migrate plugin to run the migration process between older Drupal versions to Drupal 8, but this module doesn't contain migration definitions since Drupal 8 beta 13</p>

<p>Therefore, the first step you need to do is install these modules, I will use the project <a href="http://drupalconsole.com">Drupal Console</a> for this tasks and I will continue using some commands available related with migration.</p>

<pre><code>$ drupal module:install migrate migrate_drupal
</code></pre>

<h1>Where I can find migrations</h1>

<p>After install modules Migration and Migrate Drupal, I guess you are waiting for something in UI to start to handle your migrations. Sadly there is nothing inside Drupal Core to provide a UI for migration, this responsibility relies on two contributed modules <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/migrate_plus">Migrate Plus</a> and <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/migrate_upgrade">Migrate Upgrade</a>.</p>

<p>Each module apply a different point of view about migrations, both IMHO looks like <em>Migrate Upgrade</em> it's in a more mature state. But, there is always a but, I don't like the idea that you are only available to see all migrations available when you are running the migration itself.</p>

<p>With Drupal just released it's probably that you will be in a stage where you don't really know what are you doing, so I decided to implement some migration command inside <strong>Drupal Console</strong> project with my own point of view.</p>

<h1>Loading migrations</h1>

<p>As I said before I prefer load migrations but without running a migration yet. For that purpose, I did a command <strong>migrate:setup</strong> as you can see in following CLI execution sample.</p>

<pre><code>$ drupal migrate:setup --db-type=mysql --db-host=127.0.0.1 --db-name=plato_tipico --db-user=root --db-pass=root --db-port=3306 --no-interaction
</code></pre>

<p>In the sample above I pass all parameters using inline mode, but if you omit an option, the command will start the interactive mode. Remember to remove the option *--no-interaction** to enable the interactive mode.</p>

<p>The command above will inspect your legacy DB and import all migrations available in Drupal 8 to be used with your legacy DB.</p>

<p>All migration entities created will remain in your system, even after complete a migration process.</p>

<h1>Get list of migrations</h1>

<p>In order to get a list of migrations available in your system, you must execute the following command</p>

<pre><code>$ drupal migrate:debug
</code></pre>

<p>As you can appreciate in the following image some migrations work in more that one Drupal legacy version</p>

<p><img src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/console_migrate_debug.png"/></p>

<h1>Execute a migration</h1>

<p>After reviewing your system in term of migrations available, we could execute all migrations available for your legacy system you can execute the following command to start a full migration process.</p>

<pre><code>$ drupal migrate:execute all --db-type=mysql --db-host=127.0.0.1 --db-name=plato_tipico --db-user=root --db-pass=root --db-port=3306 --no-interaction
</code></pre>

<p>Below you can see how looks the migration process.</p>

<p><img src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/console_migrate_execute.png"/></p>

<p>The image above shows how the command report what migrations fail and what migration works. As you can see each migration is independent and the migration process is not interrupted if some of them fail.</p>

<p>But if you want to avoid to execute one of more migration to avoid any exception you can use the parameter <strong>--exclude</strong> providing the migration id(s) do you want to exclude, you can get those ids from <em>migrate:debug</em> command.</p>

<p>Moreover, if you only want to execute one or a couple of migrations, just change the parameter <strong>all</strong> for any migration id(s) do you want, this is useful to execute a partial migration after resolve any issues found after executing a full migration process</p>

<h1>Where are located migrations.</h1>

<p>Now you are wondering <strong>"Where are located migration"</strong> if they aren't in Migrate or Migrate Drupal. Well, migrations are allocated in each specific module, for instance if you review in your Drupal Core modules in path <strong>/core/modules/book/migration_templates</strong> you will find some YAML files with the information necessary to create a Migration entity in your system. When you executed the command <strong>migrate:setup</strong> all migration_templates folder were parsed to create Migration Entities.</p>

<h1>Caveats</h1>

<p>Right now there are mostly migrations available for Drupal 6, I guess the bet is related Drupal 6 are more critical to be migrated to Drupal 8.</p>

<p>You can find more Drupal 7 migration proposed as issues in <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/imp">http://groups.drupal.org/imp</a> sandbox, in <a href="http://anexusit.com">Anexus</a> we propose around 70 migration entities for Drupal 7 and 10 of them were already accepted in Drupal 8 core. I promise to provide a list of all our Drupal 7 Migration in few weeks.</p>

<p>I hope you found this article useful.</p>

                <title>How to manipulate an Entity:Block programmatically in Drupal 8</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>This is my first post after Drupal 8 got his first official release, now it's time to start to do some basic stuff using the Drupal 8 way.</p>

<p>Even I have been working a lot with Drupal 8 core, there are some typical things that I found still a little bit strange. But being honest if more my fault that Drupal 8 fault; All we have just to adjust own mental mindsets.</p>

<p>Today I want to show you how to deal with Block in Drupal 8 because yesterday I spent several hours trying to understand how to manipulate a block to extend a functionality for <a href="http://drupalconsole.com">Drupal Console</a> project.</p>

<h1>Get a list of blocks</h1>

<p>This looks an easy task, but there are some considerations you must take into account.</p>

<p>First, Do you need a list of all <em>Blocks</em> available or all <em>Blocks</em> enabled?</p>

<p>Why this separation is important, well as you maybe know or hear in Drupal 8 blocks are plugins and use <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/1882526">annotations</a> to expose to Drupal 8 their existence. Therefore, we could get a list of blocks but they will not be <a href="https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core!modules!block!src!Entity!Block.php/8">Entity:Block</a> objects, we could get just their definition, this is important because you can't manipulate them, so you just can use as extra information in your logic.</p>

<p>Only blocks that are enabled and assigned to a theme and in a region are Entity:Block instances.</p>

<h2>Get available blocks</h2>

<p>Using the service <strong><a href="https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core!core.services.yml/service/plugin.manager.block/8">plugin.manager.block</a></strong> we will get all blocks available definition.</p>

<pre><code>$blockManager = \Drupal::service('plugin.manager.block');
$contextRepository = \Drupal::service('context.repository');

// Get blocks definition
$definitions = $blockManager-&gt;getDefinitionsForContexts($contextRepository-&gt;getAvailableContexts());

print_r($definitions['help_block']);
</code></pre>

<p>Executing the code above we will an output for <em>help_block</em> similar to the following snippet.</p>

<pre><code>Array
(
    [admin_label] =&gt; Drupal\Core\StringTranslation\TranslatableMarkup Object
        (
            [string:protected] =&gt; Help
            [translatedMarkup:protected] =&gt;
            [options:protected] =&gt; Array
                (
                )

            [stringTranslation:protected] =&gt;
            [arguments:protected] =&gt; Array
                (
                )

        )

    [category] =&gt; Help
    [derivative] =&gt;
    [id] =&gt; help_block
    [class] =&gt; Drupal\help\Plugin\Block\HelpBlock
    [provider] =&gt; help
)
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see is valuable information about the block but it's not a real Entity:Block instances.</p>

<h2>Get a list of all Entity:Block available</h2>

<p>Using <a href="https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core!lib!Drupal.php/function/Drupal%3A%3AentityQuery/8">Drupal:entityQuery</a> class, we can build a kind of SQL query for a specific entity in this case for Block entities. The following piece of code gets the full list of blocks available.</p>

<pre><code>$ids = \Drupal::entityQuery('block')-&gt;execute();
</code></pre>

<p>Off course we can filter the results, for instance, we could use the condition plugin to fetch all block related with help module, as you can see in the following snippet of code.</p>

<pre><code>$ids = \Drupal::entityQuery('block')
    -&gt;condition('plugin', 'help_block')
    -&gt;execute();

print_r($ids);
</code></pre>

<p>After executing the code above we could get an output similar this:</p>

<pre><code>Array
(
    [bartik_help] =&gt; bartik_help
    [himalaya_help] =&gt; himalaya_help
    [seven_help] =&gt; seven_help
)
</code></pre>

<p>I got three Entity:Block ids, related to the three themes I have enabled in my system Bartik, Seven and <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/himalaya">Himalaya</a>.</p>

<h1>Loading an Entity:Block</h1>

<p>Until now we get definition of blocks and Entity:Block ids, but not a real Entity:Block, let me show you how do that using the Drupal 8 class use <a href="https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21modules%21block%21src%21Entity%21Block.php/class/Block/8">Drupal\block\Entity\Block</a> as you can see below.</p>

<pre><code>use Drupal\block\Entity\Block;
$block = Block::load('bartik_help');
print_r($block);
</code></pre>

<p>The code above load the Entity:Block for <strong>bartik_help</strong>, if you execute this code in your custom module you will get an output like this.</p>

<pre><code>Drupal\block\Entity\Block Object
(
    [id:protected] =&gt; bartik_help
    [settings:protected] =&gt; Array
        (
            [id] =&gt; help_block
            [label] =&gt; Help
            [provider] =&gt; help
            [label_display] =&gt; 0
        )

    [region:protected] =&gt; content
    [weight:protected] =&gt; -30
    [plugin:protected] =&gt; help_block
    [visibility:protected] =&gt; Array
        (
        )
......
......
    [dependencies:protected] =&gt; Array
        (
            [module] =&gt; Array
                (
                    [0] =&gt; help
                )

            [theme] =&gt; Array
                (
                    [0] =&gt; bartik
                )

        )

    [provider] =&gt;
)
</code></pre>

<h1>Create an Entity:Block</h1>

<p>Last but not least, I will show you how to create an Entity:Block from code definition.</p>

<p>Imagine did you created a block plugin using <strong>Drupal Console</strong> with id default_block. Using the following command.</p>

<pre><code>$ drupal generate:plugin:block
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to enable that generated block programmatically, you can use the following snippet of code.</p>

<pre><code>$blockEntityManager = \Drupal::service('entity.manager')-&gt;getStorage('block');
$block = $blockEntityManager-&gt;-&gt;create(
  array(
      'id'=&gt; $plugin_id,
      'plugin' =&gt; $plugin_id,
      'theme' =&gt; $theme
  )
);
$block-&gt;setRegion('content');
$block-&gt;save();
</code></pre>

<p>Besides, I decided to assign the default_block inside Content region for theme Bartik, after creating the Entity:Block.</p>

<p>I hope you found this article useful.</p>

                <title>How to execute an external PHP application inside Symfony/Drupal in a Sandbox</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>I know this could be a weird situation, but, believe or not sometimes is required execute an external application, maybe because that application doesn't have and API or just because you just need to execute that and get the results.</p>

<p>An easy thought could be just include the main file of that application, but maybe that is not possible because both applications could use similar namespaces or try to reload same libraries, for solve that is required to try to execute that application using a kind of <strong>Sandbox</strong>.</p>

<p>To accomplish that task, we can use the Symfony <a href="http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/process.html">Process</a> Component.</p>

<p>Let me show you a small piece of code that could be included in your Symfony or Drupal 8 application.</p>

<pre><code>use Symfony\Component\Process\PhpProcess;

$php_script = file_get_contents($php_file);

$phpProcess = new PhpProcess($php_script, $documentroot);
$phpProcess-&gt;run();
$output = $phpProcess-&gt;getOutput();
</code></pre>

<p>Firstly, we must read a PHP file path, defined in variable <em>$php_file</em> then using function <em>PhpProcess</em> execute that script using a specific DocumentRoot for our external application, that will avoid any issue of missing classes.</p>

<p>Secondly, the process is executed and finally we could get the output after our external application is completed, this process is synchronous.</p>

<p>Internally the Symfony component Process try to allocate the php-cli in your system to execute your application.</p>

                <title>How to get a list of content types in Drupal 8</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>Continuing with the series of articles about how to do Drupal development common tasks using Drupal 8 way I will share today how you could get a list of content types available programmatically.</p>

<p>Using the following code you could print the complete list</p>

<pre><code>$contentTypes = \Drupal::service('entity.manager')-&gt;getStorage('node_type')-&gt;loadMultiple();

$contentTypesList = [];
foreach ($contentTypes as $contentType) {
    $contentTypesList[$contentType-&gt;id()] = $contentType-&gt;label();
}

print_r($contentTypesList);
</code></pre>

<p>After executing the code above you will output similar to the following snippet:</p>

<pre><code>Array
(
    [article] =&gt; Article
    [page] =&gt; Basic page
)
</code></pre>

<p>Off course in my example I Just want a list of values machine-name -> human label, but you can manipulate the <a href="https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core!modules!node!src!Entity!NodeType.php/class/NodeType/8">Drupal\node\Entity\NodeType</a> entity to do advanced things.</p>

                <title>How to get content type fields in Drupal 8</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>The creation of custom logic for our customer sometimes requires a certain level of automatisation in terms that our logic must be flexible to support changes in the data structure.</p>

<p>In Drupal 8 the most common way to represent data is using node entities, and we could create different types of content types or bundles for node entities.</p>

<p>Each content type could increase or decrease the amount and type of fields assigned to each content type, and our code must be prepared to handle that situations.</p>

<p>I will explain to you, how to get content type definition and use that information to flatten a node object into an array.</p>

<h1>Getting content type fields definition</h1>

<p>Firstly I will create a function to get fields definition for a content type machine name provided, of course, you can implement this function as a method in your classes.</p>

<pre><code>function contentTypeFields($contentType) {
    $entityManager = Drupal::service('entity.manager');
    $fields = [];

    if(!empty($contentType) {
        $fields = array_filter(
            $entityManager-&gt;getFieldDefinitions('node', $contentType), function ($field_definition) {
                return $field_definition instanceof FieldConfigInterface;
            }
        );
    }

    return $fields;      
}
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, I am only interested in use field machine name, but you can do a different approach to doing something with field definition itself.</p>

<p>Also, I use node as a hard-coded entity type, but you can use any entity, to get their bundle field definition.</p>

<h1>Flatten node</h1>

<p>Using the field definition array, we can get all node values and assign to an array. I will use an imaginary content type machine name <em>ticket</em></p>

<pre><code>use Drupal\node\Entity\Node;
use Drupal\field\FieldConfigInterface;

// Load node
$node = Node::load($ticketID);

$fields = contentTypeFields('ticket'); // Replace your content type machine name here.

$ticket['title'] = $node-&gt;get('title')-&gt;value;
foreach($fields as $fieldID =&gt; $field){
    $ticket[$fieldID] = $node-&gt;get($fieldID)-&gt;getValue();
}

print_r($ticket);

</code></pre>

<p>The code above will produce an output similar to this</p>

<pre><code>Array
(
    [title] =&gt; This is an unassigned ticket
    [field_description] =&gt; Array
        (
            [0] =&gt; Array
                (
                    [value] =&gt; Create a ticket with no one assigned to make sure the system handles it well
                )

        )
    [field_status] =&gt; Array
        (
            [0] =&gt; Array
                (
                    [target_id] =&gt; 2
                )

        )

    [field_ticket_type] =&gt; Array
        (
            [0] =&gt; Array
                (
                    [target_id] =&gt; 9
                )

        )

)
</code></pre>

<p>After transform node into an innocuous array, you can add or remove any information required.</p>

<p>This kind of transformation is useful in Drupal 8, to skip some validation in the object render to avoid content injection.</p>

<p>Maybe you are thinking why not use function <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.get-object-vars.php">get_object_vars</a>, well all properties are protected and are only accessible using get method, get_object_vars only return public properties, so doesn't work for our purpose.</p>

<p>Another idea could be, just use an array casting to transform node object into an array, but if you try to do that and exception is thrown with the following error message.</p>

<p><strong>A fatal error occurred: Could not normalize object of type Drupal\Core\Field\BaseFieldDefinition, no supporting normalizer found.</strong></p>

<p>I hope did you found this article useful.</p>

                <title>Around the Drupal World in 120 Days</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>Almost a year ago in 2015, I proposed my name in the <a href="https://assoc.drupal.org/election/8/candidates">elections</a> for Director at  Large in <a href="https://assoc.drupal.org">Drupal Association</a>. The slogan of my campaign was <strong>Let me be your voice</strong> with the idea to try to represent areas in the world outside develop countries.</p>

<p>Check the video of my proposal.</p>

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/121906640" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMTQ0ODU1MTUwNA==.html">Version for China</a></p>

<p>Sadly, I didn't get enough votes to get elected. But, the idea remains in my head; How I could to try to bring the knowledge to those emerging communities in Open Source and specifically in Drupal? How I could encourage people to create their solutions, using their language as a tool to empower their local community?</p>

<p>Moreover, How I could do this without the endorsement of being a Director at Large for Drupal Association?</p>

<p>Well, I got the conclusion that if I want to do a change and don't need to ask permission to anybody, and in the same way here in Costa Rica we started the Drupal Costa Rica community with our passion as our endorsement to build this idea.</p>

<p>For that reason, I decided to put my money where my mouth is, regarding what I said in my video campaign, including an additional goal: promote the tool I have been co-working for almost 18 months the <a href="http://drupalconsole.com">Drupal Console</a> project.</p>

<p><strong>Drupal Console</strong> also includes an important component for local communities empowerment enabling people use the tool in their mother language.</p>

<p>Fortunately, I got support from my business partner <strong>Kenny Abarca</strong> at <a href="http://anexusit.com">Anexus</a> to have a period of four months with a semi-sabbatical schedule to regarding work. Having 4-5 hours per day in duties to support our team regarding of Drupal 8 adoption and implementation.</p>

<p>What I will do with the rest of my time, well, we agree that I will be traveling in several developed and developing countries participating in DrupalCamps, Drupal meetups to exchange experiences with local companies and developers. To try to do what I propose last year and promote the Drupal Console project.</p>

<p>Also, Encouraging local communities to build technical documentation for themselves using their mother language to reduce their digital gap.</p>

<p>With the idea settle, we create this agenda to visit eighteen cities in thirteen countries and three continents, we want to include Africa, but due budgets restrictions wasn't possible.</p>

                <title>Getting node comments programmatically in Drupal 8</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>This article belongs to tips and tricks section in Drupal 8 because I will explain to you how to get entity comments from a particular entity node.</p>

<p>Before to start to code, I want to clarify that in Drupal 8 comments could be inside <strong>Content type</strong> definition as a standard field.</p>

<p>I will handle comments here as a separate entity. To get comments I will use <a href="https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core!lib!Drupal.php/function/Drupal%3A%3AentityQuery/8">EntityQuery</a> using this approach, we will avoid writing explicit SQL queries, and our code will portable.</p>

<pre><code>$cids = \Drupal::entityQuery('comment')
   -&gt;condition('entity_id', $ticketID)
   -&gt;condition('entity_type', 'node')
   -&gt;sort('cid', 'DESC')
   -&gt;execute();

$comments = [];

foreach($cids as $cid) {
 $comment = Comment::load($cid);

 $comments[] = [
     'cid' =&gt; $cid,
     'uid' =&gt; $comment-&gt;getOwnerId(),
     'subject' =&gt; $comment-&gt;get('subject')-&gt;value,
     'body' =&gt; $comment-&gt;get('field_comment_body')-&gt;value,
     'created' =&gt; $comment-&gt;get('created')-&gt;value
 ];
}
</code></pre>

<p>Let's review the code above in detail; As you can see, is required to specify to what kind of entity we are trying to get comments, that tell us that in Drupal 8 is possible to link comments to any entity.</p>

<p>Additionally, I have specified the Entity ID required to get comments, is possible add more conditions; this is useful taking in count that comments are entities and is possible that comments have customs fields with extra information.</p>

<p>When we create the EntityQuery, we define what kind of entity we want to process, as the result the query execution will return a list primary keys of entities matching the conditions, in this case, the main key is represented by cid.</p>

<p>Using the list of comments ids or cids, we load the comment object. I just traverse the option to create an arbitrary array, only to show how do you have to access to comment entity property, usually is required to use the method get, but there are some exceptions like comment owner ID.</p>

<p>I hope do you found this article useful.</p>

                <title>La vuelta al mundo Drupal en 120 dias</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>Hace casi un año, en el 2015, propuse mi nombre en las <a href="https://assoc.drupal.org/election/8/candidates">elecciones</a> para <strong>Director at  Large</strong> en la <a href="https://assoc.drupal.org">Asociación Drupal</a>. El lema de mi campaña fue <strong>Déjame ser tu voz</strong> con la idea de tratar de representar áreas en el mundo fuera de los países se desarrollados.</p>

<p>Puedes revisar el video de mi propuesta.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h32uIUtePB0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Lamentablemente, no he alcance los votos suficientes para ser elegido. Pero, la idea siguio en mi cabeza; ¿Cómo puedo tratar de llevar el conocimiento a las comunidades emergentes en Open Source y específicamente en Drupal? ¿Cómo pude animar a la gente a crear sus soluciones, utilizando su lengua materna como una herramienta para empoderar a su comunidad local?</p>

<p>Por otra parte, ¿Cómo pude hacer esto sin el aval de ser un <strong>Director at  Large</strong> para la Asociación Drupal?</p>

<p>Bueno, llegué a la conclusión de que si quiero hacer un cambio, no tengo que pedir permiso a nadie, y de la misma manera que aquí en Costa Rica empezamos la comunidad Drupal Costa Rica con nuestra pasión como unico aval para construir esta idea.</p>

<p>Por esa razón, he decidido honrar las promesas hechas en campaña, grabadas para la posteridad en vídeo, incluyendo una meta adicional: promover la herramienta en la que he estado co-trabajando durante casi 18 meses, el proyecto Drupal console](http://drupalconsole.com).</p>

<p><strong>Drupal Console</strong> also includes an important component for local communities empowerment enabling people use the tool in their mother language.</p>

<p>El proyecto <strong>Drupal console</strong> también incluye un componente importante para el empoderamiento de las comunidades locales,  permitiendo que las personas utilizen la herramienta en su lengua madre.</p>

<p>Afortunadamente, tengo el apoyo de mi socio <strong>Kenny Abarca</strong> en <a href="http://anexusit.com">Anexus</a> para tener un período de cuatro meses en una agenda semi-sabático, en terminos al trabajo, apoyare uns 4 a 5 horas por día en tareas de soporte a nuestro equipo acerca de Drupal 8.</p>

<p>Que voy a hacer con el resto de mi tiempo, bueno, acordamos que estaria viajando en varios países edesarrollados y en vía de desarrollo para participar en Drupal Camps y Drupal Meetups, para intercambiar experiencias con las empresas y desarrolladores locales y de esta forma tratar de hacer lo que prometi el año pasado, además de promover el proyecto Drupal console.</p>

<p>Además, intentare alentar a las comunidades locales para construir documentación técnica por sí mismos usando su lengua materna para reducir la brecha digital.</p>

<p>Con la idea definida, creamos esta agenda para visitar dieciocho ciudades en trece países y tres continentes, queriamos incluir África, pero debido a restricciones de presupuesto no fue posible.</p>

                <title>Form altering will not be the same in Drupal 8 after using Webprofiler</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>One of the most common tasks as a Drupal developer is alter a form created by Drupal core of by a contrib module to 
enable us to include our business logic or  just remove something annoying for our clients.</p>

<p>In Drupal 8 we still have to the hook <a href="https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21lib%21Drupal%21Core%21Form%21form.api.php/function/hook_form_alter/8">hook_form_alter</a>, I know, I know the whole idea of Drupal 8 is to remove hooks, but we still have some of them around.</p>

<p>But, this article is not about to discuss that hook must exist or not, Is there and we have to use until is replaced by something else.</p>

<p>Doing a form alter require a one significant and vital information the <strong>FORM_ID</strong>. Usually, we can get this information implementing a generic form alter and print all form_ids loaded and choose the desired one, or, check in form source code to verify the id in method <strong>getFormId</strong> as you can see in the following method</p>

<pre><code>  /**
   * {@inheritdoc}
   */
  public function getFormId() {
    return 'search_block_form';
  }

</code></pre>

<p>That doesn't look like an old fashion way? indeed, it's the old fashion way. Drupal 8 allow us to have excellent third party tools, and I want to talk about <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/devel">Webprofiler</a>, which in combination with the <a href="http://drupalcosole.com">Drupal Console</a> project, provide us a clever way to determine and generate our form alter, fast and efficient.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/lussoluca">Lussoluca</a> created the webprofiler module, and is an effective implementation of <a href="http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/profiler/index.html">Symfony profiler</a>, using this component to write and extension to provide the Drupal things that Symfony profiler ignore. Webprofiler start as an independent project at <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/webprofiler">https://www.drupal.org/project/webprofiler</a>, but the last December was merged as a submodule of Devel module; honestly I don't understand because there is not any technical dependency, IMHO webprofiler must have an independent project.</p>

<h1>Generate a standard form alter.</h1>

<p>Anyhow, let me show you how to generate a form alter using the <strong>Drupal Console</strong> without <strong>Webprofiler</strong>.</p>

<p>Using the command <strong>generate:form:alter</strong> we could generate an implementation of hook hoo_form_alter in any desired module, let show you who to execute this command avoiding interactive mode</p>

<pre><code>$ drupal generate:form:alter  --module="testing" --inputs="name:name type:textfield label:Name options: description: maxlength:64 size:64 default_value: weight:0" --no-interaction
</code></pre>

<p>As result, we will get the following code:</p>

<pre><code>use Drupal\Core\Form\FormStateInterface;

/**
 * Implements hook_form_alter() on behalf of testing.module.
 */
function testing_form_alter(&amp;$form, FormStateInterface $form_state, $form_id) {
    // Change form id here
    if ($form_id == 'form_test_alter_form') {
        drupal_set_message('form_test_form_alter() executed.');

        $form['name'] = array(
          '#type' =&gt; 'textfield',
          '#title' =&gt; t('Name'),
          '#description' =&gt; t(''),
          '#maxlength' =&gt; 64,
          '#size' =&gt; 64,
          '#weight' =&gt; '0',
        );

    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Checking out, the code above we can see that is just an example, and you need to change the proper form id, but, at least, we have a starting point and example about how to add new form elements.</p>

<h1>Generate a form alter using webprofiler.</h1>

<h2>Installing and enabling Webprofiler.</h2>

<p>Firstly, you need to get the latest version of devel module, because as I said before, webprofiler is a submodule of devel. Let's do that using <strong>Drupal Console</strong>.</p>

<pre><code>$ drupal module:download devel --latest
</code></pre>

<p>Secondly, just enable the webprofiler module as you can see in the following snippet.</p>

<pre><code>$ drupal module:install webprofiler
</code></pre>

<h2>Generating a form alter using Webprofiler</h2>

<p>After enabling the module we just need to navigate to your website visiting the pages with forms we can to alter, when Webprofiler is installed you will get a toolbar at the bottom as you can see in the following image.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/drupal_webprofiler.png"/></p>

<p>Now, If we want to include an extra field in theme configuration, we just need to visit page http://example.comv/admin/appearance/settings/bartik tp store form information in Webprofiler inventory.</p>

<p>Using the command <strong>generate:form:alter</strong> but now in interactive mode, the command will detect that webprofiler module is installed, and we will provide us a list of form id available and give us the option to remove some fields from form, as you can check out in the following image.</p>

<pre><code>drupal generate:form:alter --module=testing
</code></pre>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/console_generate_webprofiler.png"/></p>

<p>The interactive mode provides a list of form ids available; you can use the arrows on your keyboard to navigate through options available.</p>

<p>The code generated now will be more precise and as you can see using the Webprofiler inventory we could decide to remove some form elements and still include new ones. The code generated will be similar to the following snippet.</p>

<pre><code>use Drupal\Core\Form\FormStateInterface;

/**
 * Implements hook_form_FORM_ID_alter() on behalf of testing.module.
 * @see \Drupal\system\Form\ThemeSettingsForm method buildForm at core/modules/system/src/Form/ThemeSettingsForm.php
 */
function testing_form_system_theme_settings_alter(&amp;$form, FormStateInterface $form_state) {
    drupal_set_message('testing_form_system_theme_settings_alter() executed.');

    $form['color']['#access'] = FALSE;

}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see the sky is the limit we can create commands to do a lot of magic using Webprofiler inventory.</p>

<p>I hope do you found this article useful.</p>

                <title>Soy candidato a la Drupal Association 2016</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>Por segunda vez me presento al proceso de elecciones para <strong>Director at Large</strong> dentro de la Asociación Drupal, para elegir a un candidato de la comunidad a su junta directiva por un periodo de dos años.</p>

<p>A continuación quiero presentarles mi motiviación.</p>

<p><a href="https://assoc.drupal.org/election/2016-director-large-election/candidate/enzo">English version</a></p>

<h1>Motivacion.</h1>

<p>El año pasado propuse mi nombre en las elecciones para este mismo cargo, desafortunadamente no conseguí el apoyo suficiente pero alcance la <a href="https://assoc.drupal.org/blog/holly.ross.drupal/2015-large-election-data-released">3ra posición</a>.</p>

<p>A pesar de que yo no conseguí ser elegido; Hice todo lo posible para encontrar una manera de cumplir mis promesas de campaña, acerca de buscar formas de promover Drupal en comunidades de países en via desarrollo; animándoles a resolver sus propios problemas, sin perder el vínculo con la comunidad internacional de Drupal.</p>

<p>Finalmente, decidí honrar mis promesas, y organize la gira <a href="http://enzolutions.com/articles/2016/01/25/la-vuelta-al-mundo-drupal-en-120-dias/">La vuelta al mundo Drupal en 120 días</a>. El objetivo principal de este viaje es la promoción de Drupal 8, del proyecto <a href="http://drupalconsole.com">Drupal console</a> y estar en contacto con las comunidades para aprender sobre que necesitan para hacer crecer su comunidad y cómo las personas desde el exterior pueden tratar de ayudarles a crecer como comunidad.</p>

<p>Yo ya empecé el viaje visitando las comunidades en New York, EE.UU., India, Singapur, Vietnam, Corea del Sur y Japón. Todavía me restan siete países y 11 ciudades como parte de la gira. Pero, mi aprendizaje acerca de las comunidades comenzó meses antes de que tomara mi primer vuelo, por supuesto, tenía que hablar y estar en constante comunicación con las comunidades locales, esta parte fue difícil ya que en algunos países las comunidades son muy cerradas y su relación con el resto de las comunidades  Drupal alrededor del mundo es casí nula.</p>

<p>Lo que pude extraer de esas comunicaciones fueron las siguientes ideas:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Ellos están más que felices y complacidos de recibir a los visitantes que quieran aprender de sus comunidades y traer algo para compartir en términos de conocimiento.</p></li>
<li><p>Lamentablemente ellos se sienten aislados y abandonados de la Asociación de Drupal; básicamente, están viviendo en islas, usando un CMS que se encontraron casi por accidente.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Entonces, ¿qué ideas o proyectos voy a intentar apoyar dentro de la  Asociación de Drupal?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Librar los multi idiomas en http://drupal.org, debemos hablar tantos idiomas como sea posible. La falta de contenido multilingüe es la primera queja que he encontrado después de hablar con personas de países que no hablan inglés. Se puede decir que esto es costoso, pero las comunidades están dispuestos a proporcionar ayuda a hacerlo posible.</p></li>
<li><p>Establecer una herramienta que permita a las personas contactarse y estar en sintonía con las comunidades locales, estoy pensando en algo entre, g.d.o y http://drupical.com</p></li>
<li><p>Incluír un cambio al código de conducta de la comunidad Drupal para evitar que los usuarios traten de forzar a otros usuarios a solo usar Inglés. Actualmente, los usuarios que tratan de decir algo sin usar el Inglés, inmediatamente recibir una notificación no oficial de que sólo se permite el Inglés.</p></li>
<li><p>Definir becas que permita a conferencistas capacitar personas en países en via de desarrollo, especialmente si hablan el idioma nativo.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Si consigo una posición en la Asociación Drupal, voy a apoyar proyectos en esa dirección. Basado en mi experiencia de 8 años trabajando con Drupal como un desarrollador, Líder de la comunidad y  co-propietario de una empresa Drupal en un país en via de desarrollo; quiero traer a Asociación Drupal una perspectiva diferente sobre nuestros retos e ideas sobre cómo mejorar la presencia de Drupal en América Latina , África y Asia.</p>

<h1>Experiencia</h1>

<p>Me encontré con Drupal cuando trabaja en un proyecto muy difícil, simplemente porque los plazos eran muy  cortos (sorpresa, sorpresa) y no tenía idea de cómo empezar a trabajar en esa cosa llamada Drupal. Pero una vez que entendí el CMS, tuve la oportunidad de abrir el camino y enseñar a otros.</p>

<p>El Proceso fue muy frustrante, pero el Proyecto fue Entregado con un ligero retraso; como resultado termine amando la plataforma de CMS.</p>

<p>Mi primer evento de la comunidad fue en 2009 en la 1ª Drupal Camp Centroamericano en Managua, Nicaragua donde pude contribuir presentando dos conferencias y aprendi mucho sobre la comunidad Drupal y el grado de fiabilidad del producto.</p>

<p>Después de dos años haciendo Drupal de forma independiente, tomé la decisión de iniciar un negocio con mi amigo <strong>Kenny Abarca</strong>, la nuestra fue la primera empresa Drupal en Costa Rica en el 2010. <a href="http://anexusit.com">Anexus</a> y creo que de Centroamérica. En *Anexus** lidero el aspecto técnico de la empresa, pero, tengo que usar muchos sombreros, siendo CTO mi título oficial. Uno de mis papeles favoritos es sin embargo, el de desarrollador Drupal, donde tengo a motivar, liderar, supervisar y animar a mis compañeros al mismo tiempo que programo al menos 8 horas cada día.</p>

<p>Justo después del Drupal Camp Centroamericano en Nicaragua, empecé a organizar Drupal Meetup en Costa Rica, así como la construcción de la comunidad Drupal desde la base. Como resultado, se celebró la 1ª Drupal Camp en Costa Rica (3ª Drupalcamp Centroamericano) a finales de 2011. Hemos organizado ya 5 DrupalCamp desde la fecha.</p>

<p>Por último, la comunidad Drupal decidió crear una ONG llamada "Drupal Costa Rica" donde tengo el título Presidente. El uso de la ONG se centrara en facilitar las tareas de organización de las actividades de Drupal en Costa Rica.</p>

<h1>Acerca de mi</h1>

<p>Co-fundador de la empresa Drupalera <a href="http://anexusit.com">Anexus</a>. Tengo 39 años, casado y padre de dos hijos: Axel y Zoe. Me entretengo dando largos paseos por los pasillos de los Drupal Grupos y tengo la pasión para armar eventos para la comunidad.</p>

<p>Soy un colombiano de nacimiento y Costarricense por elección; He pasado los últimos 14 años viviendo en esa estrecha franja de tierra entre la América del Norte y del Sur.</p>

<p>Me metí en Drupal 5 a principios de 2008, después de trabajar durante muchos años la construcción de sitios web desde cero usando PHP y después de contribuir en un par de proyectos de PHP con la intención de automatizar la forma en que se desarrollaron sitios web.</p>

<p>En resumen, soy un tipo que sabe Drupal desde tres puntos de vista diferentes, desde el punto de desarrollador, líder comunitario y propietario de la empresa de Drupal.</p>

<p>As I read recently on a random post in Facebook. "A trip have three stages."</p>

<ol>
<li>When you plan the trip</li>
<li>When you live the trip </li>
<li>When you remember the trip </li>
</ol>

<p>So I am living the second part of my trip and I want to share with you what I did in this short time (48 hours) in New York, maybe could help other travelers.</p>

<h2>La Guardia Airport</h2>

<p>This was my first time in this airport I could say a small and friendly airport, I don't have any problem, and they have staff that can provide you some tourist information.</p>

<p>I bought a <a href="http://web.mta.info/metrocard">MetroCard</a>, which is valid for buses and subway; they have to machines to buy that card on opposite sides of the airport terminal B, the machine near to bus stop only operate with credit cards or coin. The metro card has a cost of $1 and you put what you want on top.</p>

<p>There three buses lines operating from the airport and the ride from the airport is free is you have a MetroCard.</p>

<p>I took the M60 bus to try to reach the Astoria Boulevard metro station, but be careful the driver announces the Astoria Boulevard at the beginning of the boulevard, and if you get off the bus, you will notice that you are not in Astoria Boulevard station. I made that mistake, but don't worry if you do that, I took the next bus M19 using the MetroCard I bought before and finally reach the subway station to take the line G to reach Brooklyn my destination, that line connect with Manhattan and many other places.</p>

<p>In Brooklyn, I meet up again with Vanessa and Edwin. They were so kind to share with me their spare room. BTW. Edwin was one of my first clients when I decided to start <a href="http://anexusit.com">Anexus</a> with Kenny my business partner a workshop 100% oriented to Drupal, and he remains as a friend.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/edwin-vanessa-small.jpg"/></p>

<h2>Phase2 and Digital Pulp</h2>

<p>My second day was good, even the -4 Celsius degrees, but I guess I was better to prepare than my last visit in NYC two years ago during NYCamp 2014 because at that time, in theory, was 7 Celsius degrees but for me was crazy freezing.</p>

<p>I did a quick visit to <a href="http://phase2technology.com">Phase2</a> one of the most well known Drupal Companies in USA and <strong>Anexus</strong> partner. I just pass over to say hello and of course, bring some Costa Rican coffee.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/molly.png"/></p>

<p>My lunch was at <a href="https://foursquare.com/v/lys-chinese-restaurant/540ce065498e413c5fa7929d">Ly's</a> Chinese Szechuan Restaurant, and I have a "Beef stew soup noodle" was so good.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/nyc-soup.png"/></p>

<p>After that I visited <a href="digitalpulp.com">Digital Pulp</a> to present about <a href="http://drupalconsole.com">Drupal Console</a> a Drupal project where I am co-maintainer, I was invited by <a href="https://github.com/FatherShawn">Shawn Duncan</a> one of our contributors.</p>

<p>The session was good, and I got some good feedback from backend and frontend developers.</p>

<p><img style="float:left; margin-right: 20px; width: 47%; margin-bottom: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/digitalpulp-1.jpg"/></p>

<p>If you want to see the slides of that presentation go to <a href="http://bit.ly/enzotour16-nyc">http://bit.ly/enzotour16-nyc</a>.</p>

<h2>Last Day and my trip to India.</h2>

<p>I am going to Departure from Newark Airport in New Jersey; I already visit this airport twice on my way to Boston. Travel from NJ to Mumbai will be my longest trip in an airplane 11.5 hours non-stop, so I am full of movies and books. I will tell you in another post my experiences.</p>

<p>I have to say the Newark airport is nice but not friendly with travelers, because there is not free wifi available.
At least I can use 30 min free connection from <a href="http://www.boingo.com">Boingo</a>.</p>

                <title>Traveling to India - Drupal Tour 2016</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>Today I am going to tell you about my experience of traveling to India.</p>

<p>As part of my trip, I did an stop of two days in New York with the aim to reduce a little bit how hard it travel to America to India and share time with some friends and other drupalers as you can read at my previous <a href="src="http://enzolutions.com/articles/2016/02/12/new-york-drupal-tour-2016>post</a>.</p>

<p>My trip started in Newark airport located in New Jersey, USA. It's a big airport. My first mistake was passed security so soon, inside Terminal B there are not a food court, and the options available were upscale, and the worst was there wasn't free internet there. So my recommendation is to verify if there is a food court available outside secure zone and maybe free wifi.</p>

<p>I choose to fly to Mumbai, India using AirIndia in a nonstop flight of 13 hours and 40 minutes, sounds a lot but was the shorter I found. The embarking process was a little mess due the airline doesn't have passenger divided into zones so was like in the good old times everybody trying to get in first.</p>

<p>I bought some snacks just in case. But, I have to say they provide us a dinner and two breakfast, the dinner was Indian food and was really good I could say the best food I tried in an airplane.</p>

<p>The vessel was a Boeing 777 totally packed without turbulences. But, in a long flight is inevitable to feel a little uncomfortable, we landed 30 minutes before</p>

<p>In border control, my experience was really good. Because I have to require an e-visa to visit India, I have to use the designed section for that and guess what only two persons, meanwhile the queue for nationals and tourist from countries with free entry were enormous.</p>

<p>Looks like the airport has free wifi, but require you provide a phone number and they send a code to your phone number, so if you don't enable roaming in your plan, you are screw.</p>

<p>Passing customs, I have to face the first source of scam around the world, Taxis. I was informed that there are companies inside who provide prepaid services. In my terminal, I found two one with the label prepaid taxi and other without that label.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/prepaid-taxi.jpg"/></p>

<p>The company with the label prepaid, inform to me that the price to Powai was 310 rupees almost 5 USD dollars, and they don't receive any foreign currency.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the other company said the price is base on taxi meter, but after request they said 800 rupees almost 260% more, but they receive USA dollars. So, I decide just change money to take the first company.</p>

<p>After paying they give you a receive and then you have to find the taxi inside a parking lot area for taxis near to the exit door. I order a non-AC taxi as you can see in the following picture</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/taxis-area.jpg"/></p>

<p>When I found the cab, the first problem the driver doesn't understand a word of English, I show him my receipt, and that say Powai and he said OK moving his head with their traditional way to say yes and no at the same time.</p>

<p>Leaving the airport looks like all taxi drivers have to stop and go out the car maybe they have to pay a fee when my taxi driver returns he asked me for a phone number to call to ask the address, and then they talk in Hindi and everybody was happy.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/mumbai-tuk-tuk.jpg"/></p>

<p>The traffic looks crazy and in any NatGeo program about India, everybody was honking, sounds like the rules have an enormous gray area, but people didn't stress a lot, so the system just works for them. After 40 minutes I get my place safe &amp; sound.</p>

<p>To end my day I decided to try a small restaurant near to my Airbnb, recommended by my host caretaker, 50% of waiters were barefoot, but when you are in Rome...</p>

<p>I order a Coconut soup with coriander, lamb using Dhaba style and lemon rice, total 270 rupees.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/coconut-soup.png"/>
<img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/lamb-lemon-rice.jpg"/></p>

<p>In general a good experience.</p>

                <title>India Day 1 - Drupal Tour 2016</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>Today I want to share my experiences as a tourist in India without internet, so today was a kind of purge or abstinence day choose one.</p>

<p>Because it's is Sunday I suppose the typical tourist sport will have crowded for tourist and locals, so I decided to stay apart of that areas, and I choose to explore the north of Mumbai.</p>

<h2>Kanheri Caves</h2>

<p>Firstly, I set my route to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanheri_Caves">Kanheri Caves</a> located at Sanjay Gandhi National Park, to reach that place I request a Uber to pick up me in my Airbnb works like a charm and leave at 8:30 a.m.</p>

<p>National and tourists have to pay a fee of 44 rupees to get into the park, Caves are on a hill inside the park located about seven kilometers from the main gate, there a service of buses with a fare of 8 rupees each way and there is also a bike rental service.</p>

<p>I skip the bike rental due do you have to provide an ID and pay a deposit. If you decide to rent a bike take into account that there aren't stands to secure the bike meanwhile do you visit the caves, the bus service starts at 9:00 a.m. ish, for that reason I take the desition of doing exercise and walk.</p>

<p>Mumbai wasn't too hot, so the walk was pleasant in the middle of a dry forest, there were some "houses", and you can find some ladies selling fruits, seed, and water every 2 kilometers approx.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/ladies-selling.jpg"/></p>

<p>In the second half of the road, there were a lot of monkeys, doing some aggressive sounds but nothing else, like everything in life the last mile was the harder position of the walk especially due the hill. Close the caves the well-behaved monkeys change their attitude and in the main entrance one animal almost take my bag with my belongs inside.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/monkey.jpg"/></p>

<p>About the caves, they a series of chambers sculpted in a solid rock mountain, Kanheri was a Budish monastery start before Jesus Christ era until 11 century.</p>

<p>To see the majority of caves do you have to hike using sculpt steps, and some of them are a little risky, so I recommend hiking shoes. There are some caves bigger that others and with more or fewer Buddhas inside, some of them are dark and creepy.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/bhuda-caves.jpg"/></p>

<p>To return I choose the bus option, I was so tired, walking outside the park for some blocks I found a tiny restaurant where I ordered Chicken tandoori masala, the dish was so spicy even that I ordered no spicy.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/chicken-tandoori-malasa.jpg"/></p>

<h2>Global Vipassana Pagoda</h2>

<p>With forces renewed after lunch, I took a Tuk Tuk toward to  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorai">Gorai</a> Beach, where I bought a round trip ferry ticket for 50 rupees. I have the say India have a lot strong of smells that maybe some people can't support, especially in you have around a fish market like in Gorai.</p>

<p>The ferry takes about 20 minutes to rest the destination, apart of Global Pagoda there are two entertainment parks, nobody will ask you for the ticket inside the ferry, but when you walk towards to pagoda there is a guy how to check your ticket and when you return the same.</p>

<p>The global pagoda was finished at 2009, and it's a Budish temple, even I am not a religion person I could appreciate how beautiful is and look like is important for a lot of  people.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/global-pagoda.jpg"/></p>

<p>You don't have to pay to see the pagoda, but only in the border of the pagoda, due inside there are always some pupils doing meditation with their guru. Outside there are some free guides providing information about why and who the pagodas was built.</p>

<p>There is another small pagoda named North Pagoda and you can use to take a meditation class if you have time.</p>

<p>To return home, I took another Tuk Tuk, due I don't have an internet connection.</p>

<p>There two important things to mention, until now I found is weird found people who speak English, and nobody tried to take advantage of my condition of tourist, well play Indians folks.</p>

<h2>Mingling with local and outsiders</h2>

<p>To end my day I have a nice dinner with J.A.M and Ani Gupta, to talk anything and everything, conversation Pre DrupalCon and Post DrupalCon are an important aspect of be part on a <a href="">DrupalCon</a></p>

                <title>India Day 2 - Drupal Tour 2016</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>After passing my first day in India, I felt comfortable about how to handle this country as a tourist, so the sky is the limit, I said to myself. I was so wrong "The tuk-tuks are the limit".</p>

<p>I start my day decided to visit the south of Mumbai; I expected more traffic that the day before because was Sunday. But as soon I tried to request my Uber I notice there aren't car available in UberX or UberBlack models, so weird right, the situation gets worse when some cars appear available, but the rate was increased until 8.X.</p>

<p>Trying to understand the situation, I did the supposition maybe people start their days in the office around 9 or 10 am, so I skip the Uber to avoid the rush hour, and I decide to walk towards airtel office to try to get connected to The Internet from my cellphone.</p>

<p>I bring in theory the requirement to get a sim card from <a href="http://www.airtel.in/">Airtel</a>: passport, a passport copy, a photo and copy of visa. But, the manager of the shop said I need a valid visa for at least 90 days to get sim cards, WTF right. For that reason, I had to call to India 911 in my case I contact <a href="https://axelerant.com/team-member/parth-gohil/">Parth Gohil</a>, and he rescue me request a sim card for him, lucky me he had two photographs in his wallet, BTW, who has two pictures in his wallet nowadays just in case :P.</p>

<p>Having a sim card, but not connected yet because the activation process takes 24 hours, Parth explain to me that maybe the user rise in prices was related with the Tuk-tuks, or Rickshaws, as they are named in India, were in Strike, as soon he mention I realize the street looks different. So, I decided to Stay couple hours in Parth hotel's room until the Rickshaws apocalypse past.</p>

<p>At lunch time, <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/highermath">Cary Gordon</a> a former Drupal Association board member and <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/ashwinikumar7">Ashwini Kumar</a> a developer from Srijian join us and we went to a Punjabi restaurant, food, and talk was so good that we forget to take a picture of us in the restaurant. Shame on us.</p>

<p>After lunch Rickshaws, ther appocalypse still happen, but Uber prices reach a moderate 1.6 price factor. So Cory and I went to visit Bandra Fort and Carter Road at Bandra West.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/mumbai-bridge.jpg"/>
<img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/enzo-bridge.jpg"/></p>

<p>I have to say that my conversation with Cory was exquisite because the told me about his experience as a board member of Drupal Association member.</p>

<p>To end the day, I had a dinner with <a href="http://dasjo.at/">Josef Dabernig</a>.</p>

<p>it's good to have time to talk with members of the Drupal community. In my concern the DrupalCon Asia started today.</p>

                <title>India Day 3 - Drupal Tour 2016</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>I have to recognize I have Jet Lag issues; I can't sleep more that 4 hours in a row. But this the biggest time difference I have traveled before in my life, so I expect in a week, or so my circadian rhythm gets use to the change.</p>

<p>As a result, today I get up a little late, so I decided to visit temples, the first one was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddhivinayak_Temple,_Mumbai">Siddhivinayak Temple</a>, the template was so crowded with queue about 200 meters, but at least, the line moves faster, so the wait was about 10 minutes. After passing the "security control", I have to remove my shoes, and everybody was offering flowers to their god, and I saw there is something related to coconut waterm that I can't understand. Sadly pictures weren't allowed.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/shree_temple.png"/></p>

<p>In general, a quick visit, and excellent if you want to try to live the experience of an Indian temple.</p>

<p>After finish this temple I walk around two hours with a real destination, I just want to explore to see how looks the real Mumbai and to find a place to take a lunch. I have to say Mumbai is indeed a city of contrast. On one hand you can see a lot of small informal business and people almost living in streets and on the other side of the same street, a vast complex of building for offices of people working for multinationals companies or hotel lie Four Season in the middle of that neighborhoods.</p>

<p>Almost in front of Four Seasons hotel, there is a tiny restaurant where I order Fish and a tomato soup. Because, in my mind I have the idea how a Tomato soup could be spicy, and I didn't say "no spice please", and guest what the did it the spiciest tomato soup I tried in my life and I could handle.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I continue my route to visit the <a href="http://www.hajialidargah.in">Haji Ali Dargah</a>, and I have to say that doesn't look like pictures, the place is running down.</p>

<p>Returning home, I got notified by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anigupta">Ani</a> that there is a pre-party meet up at <a href="https://www.zomato.com/mumbai/rude-lounge-hill-road-bandra-west">Rude Lounge</a> were we met with [Dasjo]((http://dasjo.at), <a href="https://twitter.com/_klausi_">klausinho</a>, <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/rachit_gupta">Rachit gupta</a> and others Drupal that I don't have contact, shame on me. Good food, good place and nice talk the perfect combination to close a day.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/rude_lounge.jpg"/></p>

<p>In few hours my wife <a href="http://yersika.com">Yersila</a> is about the take a flight to the USA and after few days we will reunite in Singapore, have a good fly honey.</p>

                <title>India Day 4 - Drupal Tour 2016</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I decided to do a twist on my tour and try to visit a museum. But, before I have to pick up <a href="http://ranqiangjun.com/">Qiangjun Ran</a>, Qiangjun is the maintainer of <a href="https://drupalconsole.com/docs/chinese">Drupal Console</a> Chinese translation.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/meet-jungle.jpg"/></p>

<p>Qiangjun is also organizing a Drupal Meetup in his city Chongqing as part of my <a href="http://enzolutions.com/articles/2016/01/19/around-the-drupal-world-in-120-days/">Drupal Tour</a>. I have to say hi gave me one the greatest presents you can receive as a <strong>knowmad</strong> traveler a sim card to get connected to China as soon I arrive in China, thanks again buddy.</p>

<p>After taking a breakfast, we took an Uber towards "'Dr. Bhau Daji Lad Museum"m due is a long ride, about 80 minutes, he explain to me some Chinese words and structures. when we reach our destination we foud the museum closed due is close all Wednesdays, lucky us. So, we continue a taxi towards <em>Gateway of India</em>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_of_India">Gateway of India</a> is an iconic place and mandatory for tourists, It's nice and especially when you read a little bit about his history.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/mumbai-art.jpg"/>
<br/><br/>
<img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/gateway-india.jpg"/></p>

<p>After taking some pictures, we continue walking in the direction to Marina Drive, the area is pleasent full of shops, where I can found and buy some magnets for my fridge to increase our collection.</p>

<p>Close to Marine drive, we found an Indian restaurant where we took a lunch, our random selection was Muttom Kheema and Golata + Jeera Rice.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/marina-drive-lunch.jpg"/></p>

<p>With our batteries charged we did a long walk through Marina Drive, it's a beautiful place with an excellent view of Mumbai Skyline. Sunsets and Sunrises must be great to appreciate here.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/marina-drive.jpg"/></p>

<p>After having some issues with our internet we decided to take a taxi, but due was hot in Mumbai with about 30 Celsius degrees we want to take a cab with A/C to have a relax return to home, due is a trip of 90 minutes.</p>

<p>Sadly, there aren't not too many cabs with A/C, and we finally found a "cab" associated with "Ola Cabs" the Indian version of Uber. We have to bargain the price due at the begging he was to charge us 2.5 times the regular price and the end we agree on about 1.2 times the standard price.</p>

<p>Back to the hotel, I helped to Qiangjun to get connected with the Slack group for Asian community of Drupal and telegram, some tools I think he can use to continue with contact with their APAC community. By coincidence, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ironkiat">Kiat Lim</a> from Singapore and who helped me to organize a Drupal meetup in Singapore to talk about <strong>Drupal Console</strong> was in the same hotel, and we hang out with other Singapore Drupalers in an Indian restaurant.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/dinner-singore-folks.jpg"/></p>

<p>By 10 pm I was exhausted and ready to do some work, my jet lag is getting better I could sleep 6 hours. Today the DrupalCon start and I will participate in <a href="https://events.drupal.org/asia2016/government-summit">Government Summit</a>.</p>

                <title>DrupalCon Asia Day 1 - Tour 2016</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>The first DrupalCon in Asia just started today, the conference this take was held in <a href="www.iitb.ac.in">IIT</a> in Mumbai.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/drupalconasia-badge.jpg"/></p>

<p>As usual the day before the DrupalCon official start, code sprints and summits like Business, Community and Government takes place, I have to say there a lot of people came to the sessions.</p>

<p>I decided to participate in Government summit, where <a href="http://horn.cologne/">J.A.M</a> led a lecture about Drupal in Government, and after that, I attend a session led by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/natalie-taylor-00a67012">Natalie Taylor</a> "Successful digital transformation of UK government departments."</p>

<p>After that, I just go out to say hello to some friends and try to meet new ones. The organization offers an exquisite Indian food menu for lunch.</p>

<p>With all energies I get in Contribute code sprint to help to  <a href="https://sg.linkedin.com/in/ardnet">Pratomo Ardianto</a> who wants to contribute a new language for <a href="http://drupalconsole.com">DrupalConsole</a> to Indonesian.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/console_indonesian.png"/></p>

<p>To finish my day in Drupal Con Asia, I attended the panel "Roadblocks and Challenges" as part of Government summit.</p>

<p>To end my day, I just chill out in Chillis with some members of Taiwan community.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/drupal-taiwan-dinner.jpg"/></p>

<p>As part of Government Summit, Ani Gupta, the organizer offers a party in Rude Lounge, nothing hardcore as parties at DrupalCons in the USA, but better than Drupalcons in Europe</p>

<p>Today the DrupalCon continue with open sessions, and I will lead the B.O.F <a href="https://events.drupal.org/asia2016/bofs/drupalconsole-hindi%E0%A4%B9%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A6%E0%A5%80-doing-drupal-8-code-without-speaking-english%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%82%E0%A4%97%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%9C%E0%A5%80-%E0%A4%AC%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%B2%E0%A5%87-%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%87">DrupalConsole in Hindi/हिन्दी: Doing Drupal 8 code without speaking English/अंग्रेजी बोले बिना Drupal 8 मे कोड कर</a> I will report my experience tomorrow.</p>

                <title>DrupalCon Asia Day 2 - Tour 2016</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>Second day in DrupalCon Asia and the first official day of the event.</p>

<p>Today I attend for the first time a pre-note, and I have to say that was hilarious, and people get involve in the activity, at the end the audience was invited to do a flash mob Indian style, and the stage was totally crowded.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/pre-note.jpg"/></p>

<p>After, Dries, as usual, start with the keynote where I notice the Indian and Asian community are more participative than I believe.</p>

<p>As part of my confibution to DrupalCon Asia, I lead a session to talk about the importance to have tools a content generated in our mother tongue and not only English.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/drupalcon-console-bof.jpg"/></p>

<p>Regarding sessions, I attend the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://events.drupal.org/asia2016/sessions/drupal8-theming-no-more-divitis">Drupal8 Theming - No more divitis</a></li>
<li><a href="https://events.drupal.org/asia2016/sessions/everything-multilingual-drupal-8">Everything multilingual in Drupal 8</a></li>
<li>[The largest Drupal 8 sites on Earth, and the NP8 news portal distribution] (https://events.drupal.org/asia2016/sessions/largest-drupal-8-sites-earth-and-news-portal-distribution-they-use-np8)</li>
</ul>

<p>Besides the sessions, the environment in sponsors area was just crazy a lot of people trying to hire people and getting new leads for new projects.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/drupalcon-hall.jpg"/></p>

<p>In summary, the event is named a DrupalCon and, to be honest,  smells and have the feeling of a real DrupalCon, well-done organizers.</p>

<p>To fish my day, I have a good chat and dinner with some folks from UK that lives in Thailand, I will meet with then again in Bangkok in two months.</p>

                <title>DrupalCon Asia Day 3 - Tour 2016</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>I just realise that less picture to share means I had more interaction with people, which it's good.</p>

<p>This day starts with a keynote by <a href="http://danesecooper.blogs.com">Danese Cooper</a> and his talk was about milestones in the Drupal project and Open source in India, giving recognition to leaders in India community, I guess was a good way to encourage local community.</p>

<p>After the keynote, volunteers and local organizers, performance a flash mob using India songs.  I have to say it was magnificent; they use the stage and aisles, so at any time, you were surrounded by an Indian dancer, cool moment folks.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/flashmob.jpg"/></p>

<p>I was glad in attending the session <a href="https://events.drupal.org/asia2016/sessions/how-build-sustainable-contribution-culture-your-organization">How to build a sustainable contribution culture in your organization</a> lead by <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/a_thakur">Ashish Thakur</a> and <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/manjitsingh">Manjit.Singh</a> they explain that everybody could share and support Open Source and how some ways to do that in your organization.</p>

<p>I expend the rest of my day talking with people in the hall of the event, about nothing and everything. I found that Indians were so glad and proud of held this event, and they must be especially proud; the event was really well organized.</p>

<p>Sadly, all good things come to an end, and I have to say good bye to new friends and miss the contribute sprint due I have to continue in my [#enzotour16](http://enzolutions.com/articles/2016/01/19/around-the-drupal-world-in-120-days/) Next stop <strong>Singapore</strong>.</p>

<p>I have a recommendation for travelers, arrive at the airport with time because I expend 90 minutes from queuing to claim my boarding passing security controls.</p>

                <title>Singapore Day 1 - Drupal Tour 2016</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>Today I join to my wife <a href="http://yersika.com">Yersika</a> at Singapore airport.</p>

<p>After landing was easy to get a SIM card with 5 GB internet by 50 SGD, warning, do you have to change or create a new AP in your phone settings.</p>

<p>We buy a three days card to use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Rapid_Transit_(Singapore)">Mass Rapid Transit</a> by SGD 30 each one and using the website <a href="http://gothere.sg/maps">http://gothere.sg/maps</a> we receive instructions about how to get home.</p>

<p>After checking we decided to go to the famous, <a href="http://www.orchardroad.org">Orchard road</a> and avenue full of parks and shopping centers, I found nice that there a lot of sceneries available to people to take pictures of themselves all along the road.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/orchard-road.jpg"/></p>

<p>Using foursquare we search for a Ramen restaurant and, to be honest, we get lost, because the restaurant was located underground. We discover that there a huge mall underground connected with subway stations and were more people doing shopping and eating than about on the surface, we didn't find our restaurant, so we chose a Pho restaurant and was a good desition.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/singapore-pho.jpg"/></p>

<p>With our energies restored, we walk toward <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Canning">Fort Canning Park</a> located on a hill, be prepare to walk a lot and climb hundreds step to reach the top of the hill, the part have the ruins of an ancient fort.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/singapore-fort.jpg"/></p>

<p>Next to the part we found the <a href="http://nationalmuseum.sg">National Museum of Singapore</a> where we learn a little bit about the history of Singapore, the entry it's free, and there are some feature expositions, I thunk we will return at some point this week.</p>

<p>Our tour today ends at the museum, due we felt so tired and is better to retrieve and regroup our forces for the rest of week.</p>

<p>You will notice I publish fewer pictures than usual when I am with my wife, due she had a real camera and took better pictures than me.</p>

<p>I have to say this state city is fantastic, everything works like a charm, I am looking forward seeing more awesomeness tomorrow.</p>

                <title>Singapore Day 2 - Drupal Tour 2016</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday with all our batteries we traced our plan to try to visit and do as much as possible.</p>

<p>Our first stop was in Singapore Chinatown to eat a delicious Dim Sum for a reasonable price.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/dim-sum.jpg"/></p>

<p>After our breakfast, we continue to the Embassy of Indonesia. Why, well at the past DrupalCon in India and couple conversations with some members of the community, I realise that will be more valuable regarding the objectives of my [trip]((http://enzolutions.com/articles/2016/01/19/around-the-drupal-world-in-120-days) exchange New Zealand by Indonesia. For that reason I went to that embassy to try to get my visa.</p>

<p>Before to continue I want to say I love the web application <a href="http://gothere.sg">http://gothere.sg</a>; The public transport works in Singapore. I never have to wait more than 3 minutes for my next ride and the application provide exact information about how and what is the fast way to reach my destination.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/gothere.png"/></p>

<p>In the embassy, I notice the rules said MENs can't enter to the embassy in shorts and guess what I was wearing. I was ready to appeal to the security lady, but, as soon she sees my hairy legs, she provide to me a pair of sweat pants to enable me to get inside the embassy.</p>

<p>With the help desk for visas, I could determine that I have a present a real flight ticket to Indonesia, and I am not available to buy due I have to define my visit to the Philippines to try to participate in their Drupal Camp, so I will postpone my visa request to Vietnam at least.</p>

<p>To continue with our tourist mission, we take a bus towards "Gardens by the Bay", these attraction consist of a dome dedicated to flowers around the world and a dome decided to cloud forest. The architecture of the place in conjunction that everything is just beautiful makes me felt that paid $28 SGD per person is a bargain.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/gardes-dome-1.jpg"/>
<br/><br/>
<img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/gardes-dome-2.jpg"/></p>

<p>Inside gardens, the is a  bridge with 22 meters height and 100 long that allow you the whole area with a magnificent view, the access cost 5 SGD.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/gardes-bridge.jpg"/></p>

<p>We decided to find a place to direct in direct to The Merlion, and sadly we find a place in Singapore river area. A place with a nice view and good vibe, we drunk a jug of beer, and then the menu, a combination of English and Chinese. I felt in the typical scam for tourists bad food, overpriced; I have to say we pay a fortune and good looking food but tiny tiny and with a bad taste :S</p>

<p>With our sullied pride, we continue The Merlion, and we got good pictures, ending the day we felt still a little hunger and them we find a ramen place in Four Square, right price and excellent taste, so lesson learned, double check the final price and about confusing menus.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/ramen-marisco.jpg"/></p>

<p>Back home I started to think about a technical post for my company related with Drupal 8, and I wrote the blog post <a href="http://www.anexusit.com/blog/debugging-twig-templates-drupal-8-kint">Debugging Twig templates in Drupal 8 Kint</a>.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I will meet with a local drupaler in the morning and at night I will participate in a <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/504398">Drupal Meetup Singapore</a> and of course, try to visit a tourist place.</p>

                <description><![CDATA[<p>Today we started our day with a breakfast with "Rat" a Chinese drupaler who lives in Singapore a long time ago. Rat is a Physic person by education by Drupal user since 2007.</p>

<br/><br/>
<img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/sigapore-prawns-breakfast.jpg"/></p>

<p>After that, we continue our tour to Sentosa area, to visit the S.E.A aquarium where we spend hours because we are an aquarium person, I have to recognize it's an excellent aquarium and in my personal experience with aquarium only supered by Atlanta Aquarium.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/sentosa-aquarium.jpg"/></p>

<p>After that, we took a big lunch + dinner in Sentosa in VivoCity the mall, from where you take the monorail to Sentosa.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/sentosa-lunch.jpg"/></p>

<p>At the end of day, we move towards the <a href="http://www.pixelonion.com/">Pixel Onion</a> headquarters, due they host a Drupal Meetup in Singapore today and allow me to talk about Drupal 8 and <a href="http://drupalconsole.com">Drupal Console</a> project. They said this was one of the biggest session they held until now.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/singapore-drupal-meetup.jpg"/></p>

<p>I have to say I really enjoy the session and the conversation we had at the end with some snacks, and looks like we have a few new Drupal 8 and Drupal Console fans.</p>

<p>To end my day I attend the two hours meeting "Meet your candidate" for Drupal Association elections for Director at large; You can see the video here:</p>

                <title>Singapore Day 4 - Drupal Tour 2016</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday we ( me and <a href="http://yersika.com">yersika</a>) decided to explore the area to look for a Dim Sum place, and finally, we find one, the restaurant was clean, and food taste, but the waiters was a little rude.</p>

<p>Anyway, what is important is the food and check our breakfast.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/geyland-dim-sum.jpg"/></p>

<p>We continue with our Singapore exploration, we move towards the train station and on our route, we found some people performing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_dance">Dragon Dance</a> on the street, I have to say it was a lovely performance.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/dragon-dance.jpg"/></p>

<p>In the end, I understand the dance was because I new business open, a web design study of young people, so looks like youngers follow the Chinese traditions.</p>

<p>We return to Chinatown how to see how looks fully packed with people; we bought some practitioners chopsticks and regular chopsticks to bring back home as souvenirs.</p>

<p>In a border of Chinatown, we found a gorgeous Buddha template, with a lot of offence, this temple contains a Buddha's tooth as relique.</p>

<p>Last night 吃饭/Rat invite us to his home to lunch, and I was so happy for accepting the invitation because he offers us real Chinese food cooked by himself, how good was the food judge for this pictures.</p>

<p>Back into the downtown we decided to try the Skypark and his Observation deck, even that before was raining and the day was gray. Bad idea, maybe, because was really windy and drizzle time to time, wasn't cold but don't allow you take pictures pleasantly.</p>

<p>[picture skypark]</p>

<p>Give up wasn't and option, due the company only return the ticket value under typhoon condition, so we have to wait between drizzles attacks to be able to take some pictures and videos.</p>

                <title>Singapore Day 5 - Drupal Tour 2016</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I started my day so early in the morning. Becuase, I have to attend the Drupal Association webinar "Meet your candidates" and was between 4 am to 6 am Singapore time. Here you can see the session recorded.</p>

<p>To recover forces, I went with my wife right after the meeting to look for a place to take breakfast, and we find a place which looks clean and taste, the only problem they don't speak English, but, fortunately, the menu has prices and photos for any dishes. The food was cheap and delicious.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/geyland-dim-sum-2.jpg"/></p>

                <title>Traveling to Vietnam - Drupal Tour 2016</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>It's time to say goodbye to Singapore, and prepare our next trip, In our morning we start to define the route for <a href="http://yersika.com">Yersika</a> to Australia and after several options, we find a reasonable price flight traveling between SEL &#8594; MEL &#8594; BNE &#8594; HNL.</p>

<p>Guess what we have a dim sum again, no new ones so no #foodporn  today :P.</p>

<p>To go to the airport, we use the <a href="https://www.smrt.com.sg/">SMRT</a>. I have to repeat I love the transport system of Singapore, at the airport station we return four tourist cards, and they return 40 SGD. So basically, we only expend <strong>80 SGD</strong> =  <strong>57.13 USD</strong> for two persons during six days and bargain from my point of view.</p>

<p>To try to be prepared for Vietnam I choose to change my latest Singaporean Dollars, and I got 1.5 million ( 3 notes) Vietnamese dongs, wow was the first time in my life that amount of money in my wallet.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/a-lot-money.jpg"/></p>

<p>Now I can evaluate the airport better; they offer a movie theater for free and free wi-fi, so all you need for an extended stop in Singapore. At passport control, they ask you for a little piece of paper that they gave your when you enter in Singapore. The security control is not general; each gate has his own luggage check-in procedure. So, by far the best airport  I have ever seen in my life.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/singapore-airport.jpg"/>
<br/><br/>
<img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/singapore-bye.jpg"/></p>

<p>We choose Vietnam Airlines to flight to Vietnam; the flight was comfortable, and the duration from Singapore is almost 3 hours, and they provide good food.</p>

<p>The entry in Vietnam was quite easy; we don't have to fill out an immigration form, they just check your passport and in luggage control they don't require to pass through x-ray machines.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://drupalcamp.vn">DrupalCamp Vietnam</a> organizers, arrange a taxi driver to wait for us at the airport, Hanoi is quite better that I was expecting, being honest, I don't see any communist spirit and nothing looks worst than capitalist countries in Latin America.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/enzo-yersika.jpg"/></p>

<p>We finish our day eating Viet food in the street, was cheap and delicious.</p>

                <title>Hanoi Day 1 - Drupal Tour 2016</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>Today I started my day visiting the team of FFW Vietnam, and we have the opportunity to talk about, They Drupal camp, community and how important for local Drupal business it has an active Drupal Community, was a good conversation.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/ffw-vietnam-1.jpg"/></p>

<p>Our first cultural spot was [The Literature Temple] which was the first University in Vietnam around 1025 A.C.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/the-literature-temple.jpg"/></p>

<p>Secondly, we stop in  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_Military_History_Museum">Vietnam Military History Museum</a>, This museum is divided into four sections:</p>

<ul>
<li>Early battles in times of Kingdoms</li>
<li>French invasion and their victory.</li>
<li>War against the USA</li>
<li>Vietnam army role in their society after Vietnam unification.</li>
</ul>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/hanoi-militar-museum.jpg"/></p>

<p>The have several military material, mostly Tanks and aircraft manufactured by URSS, USA and France and use in their wars.</p>

<p>Was interesting be able to see their history, because, at Latin America we are exposed only to the other side of the conflict, Seeing of their wars from another point of view was very educative.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/military-museum-b52.jpg"/></p>

<p>Later, We try to get into different places but due the hour there were about to close, so we just walk around the old quarter district, to finish with a lovely foot massage in our hotel.</p>

<p>For dinner, we hang out with <a href="https://twitter.com/webtomme">Tom Tram</a>, the Manager of FFW and organizer of the 1st DrupalCamp Vietnam, a and a friend of him.</p>

                <title>Hanoi Day 2 - Drupal Tour 2016</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday we started our day picking up some laundry we left behind the day before; Fortunately, our clothes returned completed and the best clean, the rate is 1 KG = 1 USD.</p>

<p>Our first tourist spot was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_Museum_of_Ethnology">Museum of Ethnology</a> where we could learn a little bit about ethnics that conform Vietnam.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/hanoi-ethnology.jpg"/></p>

<p>In a separate building, they have a mini museum about South Asia and a little bit about India and Africa. Behind the museum, there are typical houses used by Vietnamese's people in the countryside.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/hanoi-ethnology-houses.jpg"/></p>

<p>Also, the museum has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_puppetry">Water Puppet Theater</a> something that I never saw before in my life and in typical from Vietnam.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/water-puppet.jpg"/></p>

<p>Our next spots were located in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Lake_(Hanoi)">Weste Lake</a> area.</p>

<p>By accident, we getting in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qu%C3%A1n_Th%C3%A1nh_Temple">Quán Thánh Temple</a> but was a good accident, because, inside we found a huge statue of budda.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/quan-thanh-buddha.jpg"/></p>

<p>We continue walking to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tr%E1%BA%A5n_Qu%E1%BB%91c_Pagoda">Trấn Quốc Pagoda</a>, the best part is this attraction is free. But, to be honest, all attractions in Vietnam are cheap.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/tran-quoc-pagoda.jpg"/></p>

<p>After taking lunch, we continue walking towards <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Bi%C3%AAn_Bridge">Long Biên Bridge</a> an old bridge built by French during their occupation of Vietnam. I have to recognize I didn't know how long this bridge was; we had to walk two kilometers over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_River_(Asia)">Red River</a>.</p>

<p>This bridge was a real the cliche of Vietnam, because the bridge is used by Vietnam Rail company and on each side of the railways there are lanes exclusive for motorcycles, and you can see bikes carrying the most unusual thinks.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/bridge-bikes.jpg"/></p>

<p>I could swear that in Vietnam are more motorcycles than cellphones :P.</p>

<p>Becuase we love the <strong>Water Puppet</strong> performance we saw early in the morning we decided to attend a famous <strong>Water Puppet Theater</strong> close to our hotel, was an excellent show.</p>

                <title>Ha-long Bay 3 days - Vietnam - Drupal tour 2016</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>I expect the last three days on a tour in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%E1%BA%A1_Long_Bay">Ha-long Bay</a> area, which is a <strong>UNESCO World Heritage Site</strong> with about almost two thousand islets.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/ha-long-bay.jpg"/></p>

<p>The tour was two nights and three days, one night we slept anchor close to a harbour and the second night was in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_Island">Monkey Island </a>, In our tour were includes two activities visiting  <strong>Dau Go Cave</strong> cave and doing kayak around those islands.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/ha-long-cave.jpg"/>
<br/><br/>
<img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/ha-long-sunrise.jpg"/></p>

<p>I have to say the boat was comfortable; the trip was quite peaceful because te ocean looks more like a lagoon, I use The Internet on my first night using my phone, was almost a miracle that I have signal at that place.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/monkey-island.jpg"/></p>

<p>The second night, I use hotel lobby WI-FI, which was more stable and perfect to review some pending tasks and finish the updates required for my session in <a href="http://drupalcamp.vn">DrupalCamp Vietnam</a>.</p>

<p>Vietnam is still in winter and the ocean is still cold, only for brave people :P.</p>

<p>In my return, I notice that <a href="https://twitter.com/drupal">@drupal</a> account in twitter report my tour to the global community, that was more than awesome.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">.<a href="https://twitter.com/enzolutions">@enzolutions</a> starts a 120 day trip to India, Asia, Australasia to foster <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Drupal?src=hash">#Drupal</a> community <a href="https://t.co/r5iui82wRK">https://t.co/r5iui82wRK</a> <a href="https://t.co/mMMqJbjcuG">pic.twitter.com/mMMqJbjcuG</a></p>&mdash; Drupal (@drupal) <a href="https://twitter.com/drupal/status/704839947698704384">March 2, 2016</a></blockquote>

                <description><![CDATA[<p>After return to Hanoi, we took some time to prepare our (me and <a href="http://yersika.com">Yersika</a> next trips.</p>

<p>Sadly I have to cancel my trip to Cambodia in behalf of Taiwan, to try to have a better impact on the primary goal of this <a href="http://enzolutions.com/articles/2016/01/19/around-the-drupal-world-in-120-days">journey</a> foster Drupal 8 and Drupal 8 in Asia and Oceania.</p>

<p>Now, all my flight are set from South Korea, passing by Japan, China, Thailand, Hong Kong and ending in Taiwan. Also, I requested my visa to Australia.</p>

<p>Back in tourist aspects, we visit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%E1%BB%8Fa_L%C3%B2_Prison">Hỏa Lò Prison</a> or <strong>The Hanoi Hilton</strong> as is known in The USA.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/hanoi-hilton.jpg"/></p>

<p>This museum dedicated the most of their exhibitions to the usage of the prison during the French occupation against they comrades and how hard were their conditions; In the other hand, the show how the prison was used in the war against the USA and how good were their treatment for prisoners of war of the USA.</p>

<p>After lunch, we ended up in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Citadel_of_Th%C4%83ng_Long">Imperial Citadel of Thăng Long</a> which is a <strong>UNESCO's World Heritage Site</strong>; This museum is an important archeological spot, also have some exhibitions about the different usages of the Citadel for more than ten centuries.</p>

                <title>1st DrupalCamp Vietnam</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I had the opportunity of participate in the first Drupal Camp Vietnam in Hanoi.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/drupalcampvn.jpg"/></p>

<p>The event had a turnout about 170 attenders, with around 20% of women participation, caveats those numbers are my appreciation, not official stats.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/drupacampvn-program.jpg"/></p>

<p>In addition to my assistance, I had the option to present a session about <a href="http://drupalconsole.com">Drupal Console</a> project, I did this presentation in English with translation to Vietnamese by <a href="http://twitter.com/webtomme">Tom Tran</a>.</p>

<p>A Drupal guy for Philipines, <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/geraldvillorente">Gerald Villorente</a> also did a session in English with translation toVietnamese by local Docker community member, due, his session was about Docker.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/gerald-docker.jpg"/></p>

<p>The rest of the sessions were in Vietnamese, and with the help of organizers they give me a hand to understand what they were saying in their slides, also after a small talk with members of the Drupal community I learn some interested fact I want to share with you.</p>

<p>There is a local organization named <a href="http://vfossa.vn">FOSSA</a> with the primary objective to promote the usage of free and open source software in  Vietnam, because, contrary to what I thought, even Vietnam is a communist country, the government usage of FOSS is only about 20%.</p>

<p>The Vietnamese CMS ranking</p>

<p><strong>General</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Wordpress.</li>
<li><a href="https://nukeviet.vn/">Nukeviet</a> </li>
<li>Drupal and joomla </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Government</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Sharepoint </li>
<li>Liferay </li>
<li>Nukeviet</li>
</ol>

<p>One session I want to remark is a case study about <a href="http://bayo.vn">Bayo</a>, which is a startup-oriented to create travel community for Vietnamese people who travel around southeast Asia built in Drupal, with more that 30k user started in June 2015.</p>

<p>At night, I had some beers with <strong>Gerald</strong> and told me how he transform his life from a gardener in a resort in the Philippines to a Drupal Developer. All via a mentor and self-training. his is a living proof of with determination you can do an 180 degrees change in your life, all you need is passion and termination.</p>

<p>In conclusion, this camp was a good first DrupalCamp for their community, of course, there a lot of space to increase the Drupal penetration in Vietnam, but the realization of this kind of events is a huge jump towards that objective.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/uncle-ho.jpg"/></p>

<p>Today we decided to visit the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh_Mausoleum">Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum</a>, the entry is free, but, there is a queue about three blocks to getting into the mausoleum. Photos or videos are not allowed.</p>

<p>Inside there is the cadaver of <strong>Ho Chi Minh</strong>, the schedule to visit is tied, only four hours per day and Mondays, and Fridays is close.</p>

<p>Is important to mention that during February is not possible to visit the thumb of Ho Chi Minh, due, his corpse is taken to Russia for his maintenance.</p>

<p>Next to the Mausoleum, you can visit the some installation used by Ho Chi Minh. Meanwhile, he was the leader of Vietnam.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, we visit the <strong>Ho Chi Minh Museum</strong> dedicated to the late Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh and Vietnam's revolutionary struggle against foreign powers.</p>

                <title>Traveling to South Korea - Drupal Tour 2016</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday was that awkward moment when you have to leave your hotel, but your flight is not ready to go, so you have to be prepared for random situations.</p>

<p>In our case, we choose to wake up late and just in time to take the hotel breakfast and return to our room to continue doingsome planning for our two next destinations.</p>

<p>After checkout and leaving our luggage under hotel custody, we go out to do some typical tourist shopping. We bought some magnets, Vietnamese hats, bags and caps, and a football uniform of Vietnam for our son Axel.</p>

<p>Because we still have a lot of time, I decided to take a hair cut.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/hanoi-haircut.jpg"/></p>

<p>For lunch, we decided to take a rest from noodles, and we went to KFC :P.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/hanoi-kfc.jpg"/></p>

<p>With about still 6 hours ahead to decided to sit down in the street to drink the cheapest beer I tried in my light Bia Ho. We only pay USD 0.22 per glass; It's a light beer but don't get confuse after five glasses you'll feel I little dizzy, accompanied by a local version of Doner Kebab.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/haboi-cheap-beer.jpg"/></p>

<p>The airport process was as simple as our arrival, not too many controls, the flight was comfortable and almost empty, we departure at midnight and after three hours of flight, we arrive at ICN airport in Seoul.</p>

<p>In the airport I asked at the information desk and the provide the information about what bus or train we could take. Finally, we bought an express rail ticket to reach seoul, but we get lost in the subway system, mainly because we bought train card, put money and doesn't work, so the trip was longer than expected trying to resolve the issue.</p>

<p>At the hotel due we arrive too early for checking, about at 11 am. Fortunately, they allow us to access the room.</p>

<p>if you are interested in, see image and videos about this part of our trip, you can check out the at <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/37690888@N03/sets/72157665188490435">Hanoi album</a> and <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/37690888@N03/sets/72157664777169280">Ha Long Bay album</a>.</p>

                <title>Seoul Day 1 - Drupal Tour 2016</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>Even, we were tired and with our circadian rhythm altered we decided to go out to try to see something about Seoul.</p>

<p>To charge forces, we decided to try some local food, this part was hard due the menus aren't in English, and we didn't know exactly what order, So I made my first mistake in Seoul. I ordered <strong>Iced Noodles</strong> using a vendor machine.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/vendor-machine.jpg"/>
<br/><br/>
<img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/vendor-machine-menu.jpg"/></p>

<p>I was thinking they were talking about the noodle style, but was literally in <strong>ICE</strong>.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/ice-noodles.jpg"/></p>

<p>I'm sure that kind of noodles is typical here, but for me it was crazy.</p>

<p>Continuing with the cultural tour, we visit the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyeongbokgung">Gyeongbok Palace</a>, this palace is like the Korean version of Forbidden City in China. The price is low and fortunately, we were in time to take the Free guided tour in English. There other free tours in Chinese and Japanese, three time per day.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/korean-palace.jpg"/></p>

<p>Next to the palace, we found the <a href="http://www.nfm.go.kr">National Folks Museum</a> and we could appreciate part of the Korean culture.</p>

<p>One thing I don't get is young people were wearing typical customs and taking pictures of themselves, and others were like being models for foreign photographers.</p>

                <title>Seoul Day 2 - Drupal Tour 2016</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I started my day doing a lot of social networks, because, the elections for next Drupal Director at Large in <a href="https://assoc.drupal.org">Drupal Association</a> is open  <a href="https://assoc.drupal.org/vote2016">https://assoc.drupal.org/vote2016</a>.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/php-elephant-suffer.jpg"/></p>

<p>Therefore, I try to contact as many people as possible I have been in touch with Drupal related matters on all my social networks and IM systems around the world. Fortunately, they are a lot, and I like the idea of requesting the vote one by one and also requesting in community forums by country I use to share my contributions.</p>

<p>Of course, I didn't finish today, likely I have more day in elections process to continue with this process.</p>

<p>Back into Seoul exploring, with my wife, we decided to do some hiking, and we have a long walk today from our hotel walk towards the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N_Seoul_Tower">N Tower</a> located in a <strong>Namsan mountain</strong>. There is a <strong>Namsan Park</strong> in the mountain with roads to do hiking or jogging with facilities for sight impaired people.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/n_tower.jpg"/>
<br/></br>
<img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/n_tower_locks.jpg"/></p>

<p>In addition to the distance, the route was challenging due Seoul was yesterday between 3 to 5 Celcius degrees.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/n_park_roads.jpg"/></p>

<p>To return,  we took the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namsan_cable_car">Namsan cable car</a>, because, we were exhausted; I know I know I am not in a got shape :P.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/n_cable_car.jpg"/></p>

<p>Back in ground, we visit the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namdaemun_Market">Namdaemun Market</a> a traditional market in Seoul where you can find wherever you need.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/namdaemun_market.jpg"/></p>

<p>Our next spot was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheonggyecheon">Cheonggyecheon steam</a>  which a river that crosses a big part of the city, with sidewalks that allow you to take long walks across the river, the river it's immaculate with Ducks and fishes; the water was crystal clear.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/cheonggyecheon_river.jpg"/></p>

<p>We ended our walk when we reach the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dongdaemun_Design_Plaza">Dongdaemun Design Plaza</a>,  Our objective today wasn't try to get in, due, was too late, but we took some picture outside, it's a place with a good taste of design.</p>

                <title>Seoul Day 3 - Drupal Tour 2016</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, Seoul was cooler than the day before, So, we decided to start our day late and look for a brunch in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukchon_Hanok_Village">Bukchon Hanok Village</a> and ancient neighbourhood in Seoul.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/bukchon-breakfast.jpg"/>
<br/><br/>
<img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/bukchon.jpg"/></p>

<p>After wall inside this ancient place, we decided to continue with our tour in palaces visiting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changdeokgung">Changdeokgung Palace</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unhyeongung">Unhyeongung Royal Residence</a>.</p>

<br/><br/>
<img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/unhyeongung.jpg"/></p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/insa-dong.jpg"/></p>

<p>At night, we move to another area of Seoul to participate in a meetup of <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/korean-users">Korean Drupal user group</a> to talk about <strong>Drupal Console</strong> project.</p>

<p>They surprise me because <a href="https://www.drupal.org/user/261577">Yeongtaek Hong</a> share a new translation of <a href="http://drupalconsole.com">Drupal Console</a> project to the Korean Language, and Kim another member of the community print two banner one about the meetup and one about my [tour](http://enzolutions.com/articles/2016/01/19/around-the-drupal-world-in-120-days/).</p>

                <title>Seoul Day 4 - Drupal Tour 2016</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday was a relaxed, calm and cool day in Seoul, after doing some work in the morning we departure toward a lunch with people from <a href="https://www.pentasecurity.com/en/">Penta Security</a>, they attend the day before the Drupal Meetup and them invite me to take a meal.</p>

<p>After the meetup, they explain me a little but about <a href="http://mydiamo.com">MyDiamo</a>, so I was interested in that product, and they explain to me that MyDiamo is an application that runs on top of <a href="https://www.mysql.com">MySQL</a> or <a href="https://mariadb.org">MariaDB</a>.</p>

<p>I am interested in <strong>MyDiamo</strong> because they provide encryption in the database in column level, that helps to protect information among database users and protect yourself, because,  if you got hacked, the sensitive information would not be accessible. Implementations of this have a lot of value in a vast spectrum of business; I will try it in deep and investigate to use with Drupal 8 soon and maybe create a session to talk about this soon.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, guided by <a href="https://twitter.com/HappyJiyoung">Jiyoung Yun</a> we visit the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangnam_District">Gangnam District</a>.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/gangnam-style.jpg"/></p>

<p>She explains us a little bit about South Korean culture. Meanwhile, we walk and drink some typical Korean tea.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/korean-tea.jpg"/></p>

<p>Our tour in Gangnam ended up at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seonjeongneung">Seonjeongneung</a> which is the burial grounds of two Joseon Dynasty Kings and one Joseon Queen.</p>

                <title>Seoul Day 5 - Drupal Tour 2016</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>My stage in South Korea is about to finish, the day before was full of loneliness, due <a href="http://yersika.com">Yersika</a> continue with his trip and departure to Japan and a two days stop before she continues to Australia.</p>

<p>With no plans in my agenda, I keep doing some campaign with my friends for my Drupal Association candidature.</p>

<p>I took a brunch in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwangjang_Market">Gwangjang Market</a> on my way to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dongdaemun_Design_Plaza">Dongdaemun Design Plaza</a></p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/korea-market-brunch.jpg"/></p>

<p>The <strong>Dongdaemun Design Plaza</strong> looks like a spaceship outside and inside is the more beautiful building I saw in my life. Inside there are two levels of shops with original designs about everything, like bags, bikes, cloth, suitcases, etc.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/desing-shops.jpg"/>
<br/><br/>
<img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/desing-shops-2.jpg"/></p>

<p>The more interesting shop I saw was a business that prints a person or persons in a 3D model, but the result is almost inside perfect in detail.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/3d-model-machine.jpg"/>
<br/><br/>
<img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/3d-model-cameras.jpg"/>
<br/><br/>
<img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/3d-models.jpg"/>
<br/><br/>
<img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/ddp-stairs.jpg"/></p>

<p>I am not a shopping person, but I was tempted to buy some stuff more than one time, I have to content myself saying, OK you don't' need that or ok buddy you still have to visit like 12 more airports, you don't have to carry that.</p>

<p>In my return, by accident, I get inside <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so_B6mwGsYQ">Euljiro Underground Pedestrian Arcade</a> under the downtown area line 2. It's located from Dongdaemun Historic &amp; Culture Park to City Hall with an extension of 3.3 km, and I walked about 2.5 km.</p>

<p>The pedestrian arcade is so convenience to walk in winter and summer, inside you could find almost everything, from food, clothes, printing companies or digital lockers, so was a lucky accident.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/maps-shops.jpg"/>
<br/><br/>
<img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/digital-lockers.jpg"/></p>

<p>In the curious information of Korea, today I saw Korean public toilets and on the street I notice a golden mark in bronze, later I figure out they that to mark where are cables for phone, power lines of fiber optical to know where are located to do any inspection in the proper place.</p>

                <description><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday was officially my last day in Seoul; I  use part of the day to practice a <strong>Drupal 8</strong> introductory session I will lead next Tuesday at <a href="http://www.ciandt.com/card/tokyo-japan">CI&amp;T Tokyo</a> offices, before my Drupal Console session.</p>

<p>After a brunch, I move toward the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Memorial_of_Korea">War Memorial</a> museum.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/korea-last-brunch.jpg"/></p>

<p>This museum was interesting, and big 25% is dedicated to the history of Korean folks since 2000 B.C and their battles.</p>

<p>The rest of the museum, focus his attention on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War">Korean War</a> and their current conflict.</p>

<p>I have to say, was weird as Colombian to see for first time in my life, a mention of Colombia in an International War.</p>

                <title>Traveling to Japan - Drupal Tour 2016</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday was a day of changing a country in the trip; I  couldn't sleep well, only about 2.5 hours.</p>

<p>My flight to Japan departure from Incheon Internation Airport at 8:40 am. When I was packing, I notice the low-cost company I choose to flight to Japan have a 15 KG restriction and almost USD $90 for a second checked luggage.  So, I unwrap my backpacker bag and set everything to leave behind my laptop backpack and some pijamas, if were necessary, due I still have like 6 km over the weight limit.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the airline doesn't say anything about my luggage, and I can continue with all my stuff.</p>

<p>The Narita airport is huge but well organized, after passing control I can get a sim card with Internet connection, and the information desk tries to explain to me that there are several train operators and different kind of trains. Finally, I choose the cheapest one. The Narita airport is quite remote from Tokio.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/tokio-metro.jpg"/>]</p>

<p>In my hotel I try to prepare my schedule for this week, this week will be agitated with two sessions in Tokio, a trip an overnight trip to Osaka and a meeting in Osaka.</p>

<p>Looking the top places to visit in my short period in Tokyo, I found a website that helps me to organize my tour <a href="http://www.visitacity.com">http://www.visitacity.com</a>. I have to say I am on a hook with this web application, how I can live without this before :P/</p>

                <title>Tokyo Day 2 - Drupal Tour 2016</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday started as a quite day, I was a little worry about I could buy my bus ticket to Osaka, in the website they were sold out.</p>

<p>Fortunately <a href="https://twitter.com/kyoko_oh">Kyoko Ohtagaki</a> helps me to make a reservation on an online site, but, the adventure doesn't end there, I have to to a convenience store to use a machine with multifunctional functions to print and pay my bus ticket.</p>

<p>The machine was there, and she send me some instructions, check below, but all is in Japanese, so was so scary, because, what are the changes to screw the process following a Japanese guide? Thanks to the convenience store staff they help and they were a little confuse too and like after 10 minutes I got my ticket, and I am ready to go to Osaka.</p>

<img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/osaka-bus-ticket.jpg"/></p>

<p>The weather in Tokyo change and was sunny and warm about 8-celsius degrees,  so I decided to try again to see the Tokyo skyline from <strong>Tokyo Government Office</strong>, check the results</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/tokyo-cocoon-blg.jpg"/> 
<br/><br/>
<img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/tokio-huge.jpg"/></p>

<p>Looking a place to lunch, I decided to talk towards <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiji_Shrine">Meiji Jingu Shrine</a> located in a beautiful park next to the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibuya">Shibuya</a></p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/shibuya.jpg"/></p>

<p>To end my date, I visit the <a href="http://www.ciandt.com/card/tokyo-japan">CI&amp;T</a> offices in Japan, where I did a session about Drupal 8 introduction and a session about Drupal Console to the local team.</p>

<p>In <em>CI&amp;T</em> offices were the CEO and founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cesargon">Cesar Gon</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lmattiazzi">Leonardo Mattiazzi</a> VP, Innovation at CI&amp;T, really nice folks I have to say.</p>

                <title>Tokyo Day 3 - Drupal Tour 2016</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday was my day 35 in my 120ish travel trip; I am not complaining, but my body felts a little tired, how I notice that usually I sleep only 6 hours or less and yesterday I overslept. So, I decided to stay longer in my room and review some work I have pending.</p>

<p>After taking a great lunch, I decided to go to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsukiji_fish_market">Tsukiji Fish Market</a>, originally I have the plan to be there about 5 am, I am glad now I got overslept, because, the market is close one day a month and yesterday were that day of the month. I will visit when I return to Tokyo.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/chiyodo-brunch-1.jpg"/></p>

<p>With my plan altered I just found a Buddhism temple, this the first temple I found in Japan, it's weird because, in theory, more that 60% of people is Buddhism.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/tsukiji-temple.jpg"/></p>

<p>The next stop was at the Museum of Innovation and Science or <a href="http://www.miraikan.jst.go.jp/en/">Miraikan</a>, they have a lot of future usages of technology usage. The most impressive thing, is a 10 minutes demo of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIMO">Asimo</a> robot and other robots.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/tokio-robot-2.jpg"/></p>

<p>To finish my day, I accept and invitation by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ken-taguchi-56120854">Ken Taguchi </a> to visit the headquarters of <a href="http://www.dgcircus.com/en">Digital Circus</a> one of the biggest Drupal shops in Japan.

                <title>Tokyo Last day - Drupal Tour 2016</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday was my day 36 of my 120ish day trip; I have to say I am tired physically speaking, you know I am not 38 years old anymore :P. So, I decided to stay in my hotel until checkout time 11 a.m to do some office work to rest. I know is weird to say I will work for rest but it's true.</p>

<p>My hotel was "close" is Chiyoda area in Tokyo, so, I decided to walk to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Imperial_Palace#East_Garden"> Imperial Palace East Garden</a> a vast green are in the center of Tokyo.</p>

<p>The park wasn't special at the end of winter, but I can image in two weeks in Sprint will be gorgeous</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/imperial-garden.jpg"/></p>

<p>I continue my walk towards the Imperial Palace, again with a magnificent garden, but at the end I realize this is not an attraction the Emperor lives there, so you can't get in, some people were mad about that I didn't know why.</p>

<p>I ended my up day visiting again Akibara you bought some animes for friends in Latin America and a memory card replacement for my camera.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/anime-alexander.jpg"/></p>

<p>With not enough time to do something else in tourist aspect, I return to the hotel to spend some hours in the lobby watching a movie and planning my visit to Indonesia, looks like I will visit Jakarta and Bali.</p>

<p>At night, I took a bus to Osaka, was a special bus with three seats per row all independent and you can almost lay down, also do you have curtains to have some privacy. The trips take 8 hours, and I slept all the trip, I don't know the rest of passengers because I am sure I snore, sorry about that folks.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/annai-lunch.jpg"/></p>

                <title>Kyoto - Drupal Tour 2016</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I wanted to return to the sightseeing activity, for that reason I tried for maximizing my coverture of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansai_region">Kansai Region</a>, visiting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Prefecture">Kyoto</a> the ancient Imperial capital of Japan.</p>

<p>The trip to <strong>Kyoto</strong> takes about 90 minutes, for that reason I decided only visit the first four spot I could visit.</p>

<p>I started my visit at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinkaku-ji">Kinkaku-ji</a> or <em>Temple of the Golden Pavilion</em></p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/kinkaku-ji.jpg"/></p>

<p>Outside the temple, I saw a map where were pointed to two nearby locations to visit by walk, that lead me to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ry%C5%8Dan-ji">Ryōan-ji</a> a Zen temple well preserved with lovely trails.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/ryoan-ji-pagoda.jpg"/></p>

<p>The third place was the best in my opinion, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninna-ji">Ninna-ji</a> temple a <strong>UNESCO World Heritage Site</strong>, The entry allow you walk through ancient halls and alleys.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/ninna-ji.jpg"/></p>

<p>After all that walk I was exhausted, so, I decided to find a random place to take a lunch, but after a long walk, I found the <strong>Hōkongō-in</strong> Temple, located just in from of a train station, so I decided to visit the temple and return to Osaka.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/hokongo-in.jpg"/></p>

                <description><![CDATA[<p>Today, I continue with my exploration of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansai_region">Kansai Region</a>, visiting the city of Nara.</p>

<p>I started and finished my tour of Nara in the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nara_Park">Nara park</a>, it's easy to spend two days in this gorgeous park,  with several trial and lakes to enjoy the view, so, if you are a hiking person like me, this is your spot.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/nara-park-1.jpg"/></p>

<p>Inside of this park, you can found severals shrines, pagodas and temples.</p>

<p>As an interesting information about Nara park, I have to say that is entirely original; The park doesn't have pidgins to entertains local and tourist feeding them, instead of, they have wild deer, more than 1200, and you can buy cookies to feed them.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/nara-deers.jpg"/></p>

<p>About attractions, I only have the physical strength to visit few of them <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C5%8Dfuku-ji">Kōfuku-ji</a>,  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasuga-taisha">Kasuga-taisha</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C5%8Ddai-ji">Tōdai-ji</a>.</p>

<br/><br/>
<img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/tadai-ji.jpg"/></p>

<p>Between Kasuga-Taisha and Tōdai-ji, I took the decision of climb the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Wakakusa">Mt.  Wakakusa-yama</a>,  To be honest, I underestimate the 342 meters height of this mountain, I found it very steeply.</p>

                <title>Osaka Day 2 - Drupal Tour 2016</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday was my last full day in Osaka, and I decided to at least see the most prominent spot regarding sightseeing in Osaka, which is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osaka_Castle">Osaka Castle</a>.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/osaka-castle.jpg"/></p>

<p>Also, I bought a lot of manga for my friends, and I was worried the condition of these books for almost three more months of traveling.</p>

<p>So I decided to send a parcel to my friend <a href="http://jmolivas.com">Jesus Manuel Olivas</a>, in that way he can subtract his books and give the other book for my business partner Kenny Abarca during next DrupalCon in New Orleans. The Japanese post office said the package will be in two months in the USA, I have to choose the cheapest and slow method, due the parcel was almost about five kilograms, yeah that is a lot of manga</p>

<p>In the afternoon, I drink some traditional Japanese tea, with the founder of <a href="http://annai.co.jp">Annai</a> my hosts during my trip in Japan, we have the opportunity to exchange experiences in our communities and a little bit about Drupal business models and how the community play a significant role in our business model.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/japanese-traditional-tea.jpg"/></p>

<p>At the evening, we meet with <a href="https://www.drupal.org/user/692278">Luc Bézier</a> a French Drupal guy who lives in the Philippines and his girlfriend.</p>

                <title>Traveling to China - Drupal Tour</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I focused on preparing my slides for <a href="http://drupalcampchina.org">DrupalCamp China</a>, before to pack to continue with my trip to China.</p>

<p>Also, I tried to catch with the Netflix show <strong>House of  Cards</strong>.</p>

<p>As always  I tried to get early to the airport, due, its and airport I didn't know. I use the Limousine Bus, which an express bus from Osaka station to KIX airport, was a 55 minutes trip. Caveats, they only allow buy ticket for the same day and only cash.</p>

<p>Fortunately, I get early in the airport because the immigration queue was huge, like 300 meters, and they create a maze to try to organize people, wasn't his first day doing that, because, the maze works.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/osaka_queue.jpg"/></p>

<p>In Shanghai, I made a huge mistake; I put on my phone an older sim card I have in my luggage from Vietnam, so I never could get connected. So was tough to get connected with <a href="http://www.bootdev.com/#about">Keith Yau</a>.</p>

<p>Inside the station, I found a police station and they lend me the phone to call Keith girlfriend Becky, and they rescue me, after that we join with Jackie Chang in a restaurant, and I tried my first Hot Pot.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/hot-pot-1.jpg"/>
<br/><br/>
<img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/hot-pot-2.jpg"/></p>

<p>Until now, Shanghai looks like a big city of USA very modern and with good infrastructure. If you are wondering about air quality, everything looks ok, and I don't see anybody using masks.</p>

                <title>Shanghai Day 1 - Drupal Tour 2016</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>Today was my first day in China; I spend my morning into activities, the first one and crucial, figure out how to get connected to the services I regularly use in Costa Rica. Thankfully to some friends I could get connected using my computer and my phone.</p>

<p>The second activity was explained <a href="http://drupalconsole.com">Drupal Console</a> to the <a href="http://www.bootdev.com">Bootdev</a> folks.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/console_jackie_chang.jpg"/></p>

<p>I tried to get a sim card with Internet, but is only possible by a Chinese citizen with ID, so I could today I have to figure out soon because I am using a printed version of the metro map, how old style is that :P.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, I decided to go our alone to try to understand the city and the metro, so, I visited the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_Museum">Shanghai Museum</a>. That museum has a good representation of Chinese culture; I could visit the coin section because they were about to close the museum so that I will return tomorrow.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/shanghai_museum.jpg"/></p>

<p>At home, I have to plan my next day, because without the internet is more probably to get lost.</p>

<p>To end the day, I have a dinner with <a href="https://chankongching.wordpress.com/">Jackie Chang</a> from <strong>Bootdev</strong>, who explain to me some aspects about Chinese society, meanwhile we enjoy a <strong>Hot Pot</strong> dinner.</p>

                <title>Shanghai Day 2 - Drupal Tour 2016</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday probably was the must boring day in term of tourist. The most important thing I did was to go to the Indonesian Embassy in Shanghai to request my visa, to visit the Drupal Communities Jakarta and Bali.</p>

<p>At the beginning they don't to accept my request, due, I am not a China resident or with a work permit, but I mentioned them,  that on their website they said is possible, and I bring bank account statements. Everything was easier when I mentioned I got my visa to Australia, and that I have to Indonesian friends where I will stay. So, they request me to email the visa, and my friends have to email them an invitation letter.</p>

<p>So, I have to return to where I am staying to try to contact my friend, due; I did have Internet connection at that time. Fortunately, I could contact <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/suryanto">Suryanto Rachmat</a>, and he gave the invitation letter. Now, I have to wait a week to get my passport, and I hope my last visa in this trip.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/embassy_indonesia.jpg"/></p>

<p>After the Indonesian visa, I will have 3.5 empty pages in my passport, in theory, is enough to back home, we will see.</p>

<p>In the rest of my day, I just learn a little more about China society with <strong>Bootdev</strong> team and take a long nap in the afternoon; I will return to sightseeing activities tomorrow.</p>

                <title>Shanghai Day 3 - Drupal Tour 2016</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>After a break to sightseeing, yesterday return to the road, my first stop was at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lu_Xun_Park_(Shanghai)">Lu Xun Park</a>, in this park is located the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lu_Xun">Lu Xun</a> thumb, he was the most prominent writer of Chinese literature during their revolution.</p>

<p>The park was gorgeous, but, maybe the most impressive thing was some people doing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai_chi">Thai Chi</a> and some local dance style that I can't identify.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/lu-xun-park.jpg"/></p>

<p>After the park, I decided to go to the center and do some random walk, and suddenly I face a ferry service, and I decided to take that to wherever destination due it was so cheap I don't expect a long trip. In the other side, I realize the service was to cross the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huangpu_River">Huangpu River</a> to the financial district, so I just walk around that and take a nice walk to the shore of the river.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/perl-tower.jpg"/></p>

<p>As you maybe know I am a soup person and in Asia I am a noodle person, so I got a noodle and continued my way to meet with <strong>Clark</strong> who helps me to practice some Chinese words, and we share a coffee that I was able to order by myself thanks his guidance.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/clark-teacher.jpg"/></p>

<p>At the end of the day, I meet with <a href="https://www.adammalone.net/about">Adam Malone</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/feliperubim">Felipe Rubim</a> and DrupalCamp China organizers to take some drinks.</p>

                <title>DrupalCamp China - Drupal Tour 2016</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>The main reason to be in Shanghai is to participate in DrupalCamp China. The DrupalCamp China was organized in conjunction with BarCamp; the organizers split the event into two rooms, one for Chinese speakers and one for English speakers.</p>

<p>The keynote was presented by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacobredding">Jacob Reeding</a> and talk about the second wave of Open Source and the engagement with the community as companies and individuals.</p>

<p>After the group photo, I have the opportunity to meet with some online friends from Shanghai. Also, I meet with some people that organizing events in Chengdu and Chongqing where I am going to participate, and we have a delicious lunch Chinese style.</p>

<br/><br/>
<img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/drupalcamp-china-lunch.jpg"/></p>

<p>In the afternoon, I attend the session of <a href="https://www.adammalone.net/about">Adam Malone</a> about how to do an effective demo; I love this session because he shows us how to sell Drupal by showing possibilities and not teaching about Drupal in low level.</p>

<p>Right after, I have the opportunity to talk about <a href="http://drupalconsole.com">Drupal Console</a> project, I was real that I can show the Drupal Console in action using the Chinese language, the room was totally occupied, and I got good questions at the end.</p>

                <description><![CDATA[<p>After some drinks with friends after DrupalCamp China, I get up late and also in conjunction with the fact that there is no spring yet in China makes hard to get off from bed.</p>

<p>My day wasn't busy yesterday I just take brunch in Shanghai downtown and walk to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu_Garden">Yuyuan Garden</a> area.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/shanghai-sunday-brunch.jpg"/></p>

<p>The Yuyuan area is a place with a lot of shops related to jewelry and traditional Chinese products. Almost by accident I found the <strong>Yuyuan</strong> garden and get it, the garden has lots of canals, pavilions and tea houses, decorated with ancient rocks, the garden is huge so easily you can spend like 2 or more walking around the park.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/yuyuan-park-1.jpg"/>
<br/><br/>
<img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/yuyuan-park-2.jpg"/></p>

<p>Back home, I just did some laundry, watch couples movies and thinking and planning a little bit about my trip to Indonesia.</p>

                <title>Shanghai Day 5 - Drupal Tour 2016</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>Back to Shanghai, I did a group with <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/mparker17">Matthew Parker</a> from Canada and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacobredding">Jacob Redding </a> from the USA to do some sightseeing in the city.</p>

<p>Our first stop was in <a href="http://www.smartshanghai.com/venue/1701/fabric_market_shanghai">South Bund Fabric Market</a> where Jacob order to manufacture some shirts, the price for a shirt was about USD 15 a full suit about USD 200; the prices were indeed good.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/jacob-taylor.jpg"/></p>

<p>After having a lunch in the financial district, we visited the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriental_Pearl_Tower">Oriental Pearl Tower</a>, it's not the taller structure in Shanghai, but it's the second taller tourist tower in the world.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/oriental-perl_tower.jpg"/></p>

<p>The tower at the top was named "Space Capsule" the view wasn't good due the glass was dirty, I can imagine how difficult is clean that, but common that is your business, that floor was located at 350 meters. In the floor bellow was located at 263 meters the view was quite better here, but the visibility of the city wasn't  good due the level of pollution which was 160 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_quality_index">AQI</a> according to <a href="http://aqicn.org/city/shanghai">World Air Quality Index team</a> which is unhealthy.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/shanghai-pollution.jpg"/></p>

<p>The best part of the tower is a transparent observatory, where you can walk on a glass floor and deal with your levels of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrophobia">Acrophobia</a>.</p>

<br/><br/>
<img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/glass-floor-2.jpg"/></p>

<p>At the bottom of the tower, you could visit a Shanghai History Museum.</p>

<p>At night, I went to <a href="https://it-consultis.com/">IT Consultis</a> office to meet with some developers and his Chief Operating Officer. Their office is located close to French concession neighborhood so went to in bar to have some drink about how is working in China society.</p>

                <title>Traveling to Beijing - Drupal Tour 2016</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>Leaving a city is almost a weird feeling in this trip, because, I have to leave behind a lot of fantastic people and in Shanghai I met a lot of good fellas.</p>

<p>On my way to the subway station, something itches in my brain; I didn't realise what it is until the last moment. What is that well I was about to going to the wrong airport. Shanghai has two airports the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_Pudong_International_Airport">PVG</a> I used this airport when I arrive and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_Hongqiao_International_Airport">SHA</a> in the totally opposite directions. Fortunately, I double check, and I could fix my direction; otherwise, I will miss my flight for sure.</p>

<p>At Beijing airport, a member of <a href="thinkindrupal.com">Think Drupal</a> the only Drupal workshop in Beijing pick up me at the airport and help me to reach my hotel.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/bejining-pickup.jpg"/></p>

<p>At night, I meet with the rest of the team of <strong>Think Drupal</strong>, was a reunion, because, I meet <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/g089h515r806">Howard Ge</a> 3 years ago in <a href="https://portland2013.drupal.org">DrupalCon Portland</a>.</p>

<p>As is expected we ended up in a Chinese restaurant to enjoy Chinese food Beijing style, but not any restaurant they invite me to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quanjude">Quanjude Peking Duck</a> which a restaurant with a restaurant with a lot of history.</p>

                <title>Beijing Day 1 - Drupal Tour 2016</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>Last week I learned a term used in China, <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/apec-blue-skies-fail-cheer-beijing-residents-government-rushes-clean-air-ahead-summit-1721371">APEC Blue Sky</a> in reference a clear sky that happens in China during an APEC meeting in Beijing two years ago. Before landed in Beijing I was a little worried about the quality of air, but, until now I have been so luck; because after two days I have been a good quality of air and almost an APEC blue sky, I still have 8 more days here so I will see how lucky I am.</p>

<p>Yesterday in the morning I was a little frustrated, due my hotel internet connection sucks, and I can't determine how to reach famous sightseeing places in Beijing, so, I decided to sleep a bit more and just leave my hotel ready to attend the Drupal Meetup in Beijing.</p>

<p>The Drupal community was receptive, taking into account that the event was on a Saturday afternoon, and we are in the middle of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qingming_Festival">Qingming Festival</a></p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/beijing-meetup.jpg"/></p>

<p>Besides me, a local business owner presents about some Drupal projects he is working.</p>

<p>As you can imagine, we went to take an early dinner or a late lunch in my case, as always delicious food.</p>

                <description><![CDATA[<p>It's pretty normal in our lives to take somethings granted, in my case as a person living in Costa Rica, quality of air is one of them. I didn't remember the last time I see the sky back home to check the color, but here in Beijing is the first thing I do then I reach the street.</p>

<p>Fortunately for me, yesterday was another <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/apec-blue-skies-fail-cheer-beijing-residents-government-rushes-clean-air-ahead-summit-1721371">APEC Blue Sky</a> in Beijing.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/apec_bue.jpg"/></p>

<p>I started my day visiting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhongshan_Park_(Shanghai)">Zhongshan_Park</a> which is a flower park with some pavilion and trail decorated.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/zhongshan-1.jpg"/>
<br/><br/>
<img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/zhongshan-2.jpg"/></p>

<p>Next to the part is the main entry to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbidden_City">Forbidden City</a> which was the resident of China emperors and have an enormous quantity of squares and palaces, takes me about 3 hours walking across, but it's worth the effort.</p>

                <description><![CDATA[<p>All my experience in Beijing have been during a long weekend that ends yesterday, but until now I have to say Beijing is extraordinarily crowded. At some moments I feel the overpopulation problem, not really in the subway, because there are a lot of wagons and very frequent, but outside is different, thousands and thousands for folks.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/bejing-crowded.jpg"/></p>

<p>Yesterday the blue sky was gone, but nothing worsts that Shanghai. But, due yesterday is holiday my option were limited.</p>

<p>So I decided to check if  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiananmen">Tian'anmen</a> was open and it was, and I decided to visit the Tower. Something weird for me was that the security was quite more strict compared with the <strong>Forbidden City</strong>, looks like the Tian'anmen represent the current government, and the Forbidden City is just a tourist trap.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/tianamen-tower.jpg"/></p>

<p>After finish, I just took a walk outside the palace around the canal that surround the palace.</p>

<p>To return to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiananmen_Square">Tian'anmen square</a>, I have to take a long and crowded queue again to past the security control. All important places around the plaza were closed due the holiday, but still were a lot of people like me taking photos of the places.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/tianamen_square.jpg"/></p>

<p>Behind the Mao mausoleum, I found the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhengyangmen">Zhengyangmen</a> an ancient gate of Beijing and was open, so I did just to finish my tour.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/zhengyangmen-1.jpg"/>
<br/><br/>
<img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/zhengyangmen-2.jpg"/></p>

<p>I will return to the rest of places, but yesterday I found a shortcut with less people apparently we will see tomorrow.</p>

                <description><![CDATA[<p>One of the most interesting things about China is their history and how their people react with their values. Yesterday  I went to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mausoleum_of_Mao_Zedong">Mausoleum of Mao Zedong</a> to see how to be loved is he nowadays.</p>

<p>Chinese people mostly visit this place, I was one of the only few foreigners in the place, and I could fell that people truly loved him especially people with 40+ years old.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/mausoleum-mao.jpg"/></p>

<p>To continue with my cultural interaction, I visit the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Museum_of_China">National Museum of China</a>, the museum is vast and is normal because covering thousands of years of history is not an easy task.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/nmc.jpg"/></p>

<p>Maybe the most interest thing is that they have a calligraphy exposition in several rooms, to be honest, everything looks the same for me, and I don't have the culture to understand the beauty, but is the same with art for me.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/calligraphy.jpg"/></p>

<p>To finish my day I have a dinner with <strong>Wang Jian</strong> from <a href="http://thinkindrupal.com">Think Drupal</a></p>

                <description><![CDATA[<p>With the return of the activity in Beijing after their last festival, the quality of air is getting worst and worst, but I am here, and I have to try to go out to see the city and places around. So, my last stop was at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Palace">Summer Palace</a>.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/summer-palace-1.jpg"/></p>

<p>The summer palace is located about one hour from Beijing downtown, are an enormous place with a lot of trails, pavilion, temples, canals and houses. The only problem is that everything is situated on a hill, therefore,  a lot of stairs.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/summer-palace-2.jpg"/>
<br/><br/>
<img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/summer-palace-3.jpg"/></p>

<p>In the other side of the hill there a lake, I skip the tour in the lake due the view wasn't good due the quality of air, maybe in summer is better.</p>

                <title>The Great Wall - Drupal Tour 2016</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>Running away from the bad quality of air I decided to visit the most landmark in Beijing the mythical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Wall_of_China">Great Wall</a> and more concrete in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutianyu">Mutianyu</a> section.</p>

<p>Usually, do you see the joke about tourist places and the differences Expectative vs. Reality, well, I have to say my really in The Great Wall, overpass the expectation. Maybe because was Thursday or because was early about 9 AM but outside the seven persons in my tour we only five like other five individuals, actually because I travel by myself was hard to find someone who could take me a picture, in general, an awesome experience.</p>

<br/><br/>
<img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/thegreatwall-2.jpg"/></p>

<p>As a curious aspect to get the top of the Great Wall they have to services on is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_car">Cable car</a> and an a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairlift">Chairlift</a>.</p>

<p>I have to confess I never use a <strong>Chairlift</strong> before. But, I don't think is normal to stand, and wait that the chair hit you and in one second do you have to accommodate yourself the seat. When you get the destination does you have to hurry up, because the system doesn't stop, do you have to run and get off, or you will stay in the loop, maybe is the Chinese version.</p>

<p>When you finish, do you have an extra option to go down, which a toboggan, so I took it, and I have to say is so funny and maybe is a little insecure.</p>

<p>As part of the tour they lead us into a Jade shop trap and I got caught. Continuing with the tour they drive us into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming_tombs">Ming Tombs</a></p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/ming_tombs.jpg"/></p>

<p>In an unexpected stop in the tour, they lead us into a Teahouse trap for tourist, to taste some Chinese teas and learn about tea culture, I didn't buy anything here due it was expensive and I don't think so Australian government will allow me to enter that in Australia.</p>

<p>Back in Beijing I was happy to see the winds return to the city, and the sky was blue again, and the quality of air was in a city normal levels. compare the picture in the morning vs.  the picture at the afternoon.</p>

                <title>Traveling to Chongqing - Drupal Tour 2016</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>Living the America (The continent not in the USA), our knowledge about Asia is very limited, China is not the exception. In general, we only knew about few cities in China, Bejing or Peking, Shanghai and Hong Kong ( I know Hong Kong is a king of a country).</p>

<p>With that in context, I could say yesterday I travel the middle of nowhere in China real mainland. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chongqing">Chongching</a> it's like a second level city in China. But don't get confuse with that title; because the metro area has 30+ million residents, that mean is bigger that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City">Mexico City</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai">Mumbai</a>.</p>

<p>Chongqing is located close to the Tibet and by close I mean 1500 kilometres, but is the closer than my usual location, I will miss this time,  I have to left something unseen to have an excuse to return.</p>

<p>My flight was good just almost 3 hours and  <a href="http://ranqiangjun.com">Qiangjun Ran</a> with other members of the local Drupal community were waiting for me to lead me to my hotel. Later on, they invited me to eat a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_pot">Hot Pot</a> and I survive, of course, they told me they choose a beginner level for me.</p>

<p>After dinner, we have a walk around the are just to get familiar and reduce the changes I get lost the next days, I really appreciate that, Chongqing guys are excellent hosts.</p>

                <title>Chongqing Day 1 - Drupal Tour 2016</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>Usually, Mondays are a difficult day to start in a new city on this trip due; almost all sightseeing is close on Mondays, but it's what it's.</p>

<p>So, I started my day figure out how to buy a city card in the subway, getting some cash and looking for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciqikou,_Chongqing">Ciqikou</a> sometimes call a little Chongqing and for me is like a cultural <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inception">inception</a>; Because is a Chinatown inside China.</p>

<p><strong>Ciqikou</strong> It's a place full of Chinese shop local food and all you can expect in a Chinatown district, but the part that was missing is not Asian people, I guess I was the only, not Asian person there.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/ciqikou.jpg"/></p>

<p>Inside middle of the old city, I visit the <strong>Bao Lun Buddhist Temple</strong>, beautiful and cheap I have to admit.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/bao-lun-temple.jpg"/></p>

<p>In the end, the challenging task was to try to get a not hotpot lunch in the tourist area because that is the most interesting food of <strong>Chongqing</strong> but I had one last night, and I want a change. Finally, I got some noodles non-spicy, and I consider that a triumph.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/chongqing-lunch-1.jpg"/></p>

<p>I decided to return to literally recharge batteries; I have time to plan a little bit my visit to Melbourne and Sydney, Australia, looks like that meetups are settled down and I found a hotel in Bangkok.</p>

<p>After taking a nap, I go out to have a dinner with <a href="ranqiangjun.com">Jungle</a></p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/chongqing-dinner-1.jpg"/></p>

<p>We finish our night walking and talking, and we end up in a bookstore where he gave a Chinese book for children.</p>

                <description><![CDATA[<p>I expend half day working with the rest of people involve in core development of <a href="http://drupalconsole.com">Drupal Console</a> project. We have to define what we will include in our next release 1.0.0-alpha and take some architecture desition about how to enable external cooperation and determine how to modularize our code to publish some components to be used in other projects.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/three-gores.jpg"/></p>

<p>After lunch, I went to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Gorges_Museum">Three Gores</a> museum; that museum dedicates part of his space to explain the impact of this project, which is the biggest hydro electrical project until now in the world. But also display other sections</p>

<ul>
<li>Glorious Three Gorges;</li>
<li>Ancient Ba-Yu – early history of Chongqing;</li>
<li>Chongqing: the City Road – 20th-century history;</li>
<li>The Anti-Japanese War (1937–1945).</li>
</ul>

<p>Close to the museum they have the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Hall_of_the_People_(Chongqing)">Great Hall of the People</a> used by Chinese Communist Party in their conversation, is beautiful outside, but inside is just a big theater.</p>

<br/><br/>
<img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/chongqing-hall-people-inside.jpg"/></p>

<p>Back home, I expend some time in planning and could book my flights to  Philipines and Indonesia, and continue with emails to define meetups in Sydney, Australia, and Hilo, Hawaii.</p>

<p>To finish my night, I just went out with <strong>Jungle</strong> to eat the Chinese speciality of night; tonight was fish.</p>

                <description><![CDATA[<p>I expend half day of yesterday doing some chores for <a href="http://anexusit.com">Anexus</a> and continue with my sightseeing in the afternoon.</p>

<p>My friend <a href="http://ranqiangjun.com">Jungle</a> recommend me the <a href="https://en.tripadvisor.com.hk/Attraction_Review-g294213-d8113651-Reviews-Chongqing_Garden_Expo_Park-Chongqing.html">Chongqing Garden Expo</a>, so after having a  brunch I toward to that park.</p>

<p>The <strong>Garden Expo</strong> was far from my hotel, almost two hours using the subway, and I get lost, and my internet was failing. Fortunately,  my friend <strong>Jungle</strong> rectify the instructions and after take a bus I was there.</p>

<p>Beeing honest, I was a little upset due how long the park is, and the fact it was drizzling and I didn't have an umbrella; But, I was there, and I have to see the place. The park has a "bus" services using golf cars show can see all park in few minutes, so I decided to take the bus.</p>

<p>As soon the golf car leaves the station and drove into the park my mood entirely change; Because the park is full of trails, lakes, cascades, shrines, temples and a lot of beautiful gardens. Even though was drizzling the view was gorgeous, so I get off the golf car and start walking on my own.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/expo-park-1.jpg"/>

<br/><br/>
<img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/expo-park-3.jpg"/></p>

<p>I don't think, so my mobile camera was enough to capture the beauty of this place, so far, my favorite place in Chongqing city.</p>

                <description><![CDATA[<p>As part of my preparation for DrupalCamp Chongqing  I have to stop a little bit my sightseeing to finish my tweaks in my, Drupal Console slides to add the latest features and finish my keynote slides.</p>

<p>Also, I work a little bit in <a href="http://anexusit.com">Anexus</a> doing a research of an issue related with Drupal <a href="https://drupalcommerce.org">Commerce</a> and Search API and expose filters. I have to reckon that I never use Search API and his integration with <strong>Drupal Commerce</strong>, but I am glad that I could understand how works and fix the problem.</p>

<p>Also, I participate in the weekly podcast about <a href="http://drupalconsole.com">Drupal Console</a> project named <strong>The China plugin</strong>, where we talked about next event, latest changes and what is coming on the project next weeks.</p>

                <title>DrupalCamp Chongqing - Drupal Tour 2016</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday was a big day for Drupal Community in Chongqing, China, due they celebrate their first <a href="2016.drupalchongqing.org">DrupalCamp</a>.</p>

<p>The Drupal community in China in general in just growing and growing and Chongqing community organize this DrupalCamp in 50 days. Their speakers came from Beijing, Shanghai and other major Chinese cities.</p>

<p>One impressive fact is the support of <a href="http://english.cqmu.edu.cn/">Chongqing medical university</a> and more specifically their <strong>Clinical Medicine</strong> program, this program is using Drupal to improve the information system and doing research to connect with Open Hardware, which is quite interesting.</p>

<p>Regarding numbers, the event had about 120+ attendees; this is not an official statistic, is just my appreciation.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/drupalcamp_chongqing.jpg"/></p>

<p>I had the honor of being the Keynote in this event, in my session I talk about why "<strong>Investing in the community is a good business</strong>", you can review the slides <a href="http://bit.ly/enzotour16-chongqing">here</a>.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/drupalcamp-chongqing-keynote.jpg"/></p>

<p>Also, I have the opportunity of talk about <a href="http://drupalconsole.com">Drupal Console</a> project; I lead this session with <a href="http://ranqiangjun.com">Jungle</a> who by the way is the responsible for the Chinese translation of Drupal Console and the leader and co - organizer of this Drupalcamp.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/drupalcamp-chongqing-console.jpg"/></p>

<p>Based on some comments I could say this Drupal Camp set a precedent in Drupal Chinese community. Next events over China will try to imitate their level of organization and try to be more official which means in Chinese culture perhaps more political, but maybe that is what is necessary to increase the participation of China in Drupal international community.</p>

<p>Well done Chongqing.</p>

                <title>Chengdu Drupal Meetup - Drupal Tour 2016</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>After Drupal Camp Chongqing I departure to Chengdu, this city is famous due they host the biggest Panda reservoir in the world, but also they have a local Drupal Community.</p>

<p>To reach Chengdu I took a High-Speed train, operated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Railway_High-speed]">China Railway High-speed</a>. The service is comfortable and efficient, even the fact I was in <strong>second class</strong> I have a huge space for me and my huge backpack. The train sometimes reaches 296 km by an hour, but you don't feel the speed, at times we run in parallel with a highway, and you can notice the cars looks slow in compare with the train.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/CRH2C.jpg"/></p>

<p>Maybe in the sad news, I have to report I lost my phone. I lost between last subway station and my walk to train station, nobody stole just felt down from my bad I notice because my extra battery charge impact the floor and I hear the sound but due my phone protector I couldn't hear.</p>

<p>Right after arriving in Chengdu, I move towards to the <a href="http://www.cdut.edu.cn/english">Chengdu University of Technology</a>. During this meetup, I have the opportunity to lead an introduction to Drupal 8 and a Introduction to Drupal Console. Thanks to <a href="http://blog.libruce.cn">Bruce</a> becuase he translate to Chinese my words for almost 3 hours and also organize the meetup with <strong>Skip</strong>.</p>

<p>After having a delicious dinner, the locals help me to buy a new phone, I just realize that Lenovo bought Motorola and now and rebranding a new brand of phones named <strong>Zuk</strong> and I bought a <strong>Zuk 1</strong></p>

                <title>Chengdu Day 1 - Drupal Tour 2016</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>I didn't have too much time in Chengdu only two nights, but I decided to visit Chengdu for two reasons a Drupal Meetup and to see the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chengdu_Research_Base_of_Giant_Panda_Breeding">Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding</a>.</p>

<p>A lot of people hear at least hear that there a place in China with a lot of Pandas, well this place in Chengdu. Fortunately, I have a local guide from Drupal Community; <a href="http://leilei.libruce.cn">Peter</a> who companion me to the <strong>Giant Panda Breeding</strong> and other places in Chengdu.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/chengdu-peter.jpg"/></p>

<p>The Panda base in a vast area that hosts a project to protect panda population and execute programs to try to increase the population. For tourists like me, they have some pandas living in a "controlled environment." Outside the regular pandas, they also have a reservoir for "Red Pandas" if you are not familiar with that animal, just think is <a href="firefox.com">Firefox</a> browser logo, the animal is a Red Panda, not a fox.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/chengdu-panda-1.jpg"/>
<br/><br/> 
<img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/chengdu-panda-2.jpg"/>

<br/><br/> 
<img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/chengdu-red-panda.jpg"/></p>

<p>After lunch, we move on towards <a href="https://www.travelchinaguide.com/attraction/sichuan/chengdu/wide-narrow-alley.htm">Kuanzhai Xiangzi</a> which are old streets where you can find a lot of restaurants, snacks places, and Chinese handcrafts.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/kuanzhai-xiangzi-1.jpg"/>
<br/><br/> 
<img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/kuanzhai-xiangzi-2.jpg"/></p>

<p>Maybe the most interesting thing I found in this place was a kind of mini theater that presented <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuanese_opera">Sichuan Opera</a>, this style combines music, comedy, magic and kung fu, I totally recommend this activity.</p>

<p>To finish our day we have a Hot Pot fish for dinner.</p>

                <description><![CDATA[<p>On my [tour](http://enzolutions.com/articles/2016/01/19/around-the-drupal-world-in-120-days/) this was the shorter stop, only two days. So I get up early and try to visit couple places in the morning just to have a glance of Chengdu.</p>

<p>Firstly, I decided to visit the <strong>Manjusri Monastery</strong> or Wenshu Monastery/文殊院, which is a buddies temple, with a lot of monks inside and looks like there are residences for them behind the temples.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/manjusri-monastery-1.jpg"/>
<br/><br/> 
<img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/manjusri-monastery-2.jpg"/></p>

<p>I was a little worry about the traffic, so I have other places in my list, but I  prefer to walk around to check, and I see, and I found the <strong>Aidao Nunnery</strong> or Ancient Yuanjue Nunnery. This temple was reconstructed this century and have a good shape and nice decorations.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/aidao-nunnery-1.jpg"/>
<br/><br/> 
<img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/aidao-nunnery-2.jpg"/></p>

<p>At the afternoon, I said goodbye to China and departure to Bangkok, Thailand. I know you could say, but you will go to Hong Kong and Taiwan, well those are other Chinas like Singapore.</p>

                <title>Bangkok Day 1 - Drupal Tour 2016</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>For about two months the temperature of place I have been visiting fluctuate between 1 Celsius degrees to 21 Celsius degrees; Yesterday I arrive in Bangkok, Thailand, and the weather punch me so hard, having a 32 Celsius degrees is not easy to less walk and more taxi in this part of my trip.</p>

<p>For my sightseeing, I follow a guide prepared by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mledu">Michael Ledu</a> a friend from NYC and married with a Thailand girl.</p>

<p>So, following his advice, I went out first into <a href="http://www.jimthompsonhouse.com">Jim Thompson House</a> wich is an excellent tour of a somewhat traditional Thai house that is rare in Bangkok.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/jim-thompson-house-1.jpg"/>
<br/><br/> 
<img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/jim-thompson-house-2.jpg"/></p>

<p>After that visit, I tried to walk but as I said before the heat was overwhelming, so I took a taxi to <a href="http://www.nitasrattanakosin.com">Rattanakosin Exhibition Hall</a>. This museum is well organized and they have three guides tours, but it's literally a guided tour, room after room they have a person that explain to you what is the exhibition about, and they have devices to listed audios in English for the videos the present.</p>

<p>The list of tours are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Grandeur Rattanakosin</strong></li>
<li><strong>The colorful Thai of living</strong></li>
<li><strong>The heart and soul of the nation</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Indeed was a great introduction to Thai culture and their history.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/rattanakosin-1.jpg"/>
<br/><br/> 
<img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/rattanakosin-2.jpg"/></p>

<p>Next, the museum I found the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wat_Ratchanatdaram">Metal Palace Temple</a> a complex of halls and temples, the place is under restoration, but indeed in quite a beautiful</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/wat_ratchanatdaram-1.jpg"/>
<br/><br/> 
<img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/wat_ratchanatdaram-2.jpg"/>
<br/><br/>
<img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/wat_ratchanatdaram-3.jpg"/>
<br/><br/> 
<img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/wat_ratchanatdaram-4.jpg"/></p>

<p>Walking around I found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wat_Saket">The Golden Mount</a> which is a is a Buddhist temple in a mountain, that place provide a beautiful view of the city, and I like the option of playing giant gongs.</p>

                <title>Bangkok Drupal Meetup - Drupal Tour 2016</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>I am in the second half of my Enzo Tour 2016, the main reason to be in Bangkok was to participate in their Drupal Meetup.</p>

<p>The Drupal meetup was organized by <a href="http://www.fluxus.io/">Fluxus</a>, I met these guys in Mumbai, India during DrupalCon and after that in Hanoi during their first DrupalCamp, so as you can see they are all about community.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/bkk-drupal-meetup.jpg"/></p>

<p>As you can imagine, I did an introduction to Drupal 8.1 and <a href="http://drupalconsole.com">Drupal Console</a></p>

<p>I have to thank you to <a href="http://x-team.com/profile/sven-ryen/">Sven Berg Ryen</a> from Norway who attend this meeting after having a flight of 12 hours from Oslo and be in an immense jet lag.</p>

<p>Before the Drupal Meetup, I did some sightseeing in Bangkok. I went out to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ananta_Samakhom_Throne_Hall">Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall</a> an exhibition of the Masterpieces of Thailand, sorry no pictures because they aren't allowed, but I could tell you I never saw that amount of gold in my life and the quality of pieces is really astonishing.</p>

                <title>Bangkok Day 2 - Drupal Tour 2016</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>Maybe you don't know by my [tour](http://enzolutions.com/articles/2016/01/19/around-the-drupal-world-in-120-days/) something require extra attention regarding planning, just to confirm everything will match with the plans of local communities. For that reason Yesterday, I expend all my morning dealing with Medical insurances, booking of hotels and coordinate with local organizers details about the sessions.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, I had lunch with <a href="http://www.fluxus.io/">Fluxus</a> team.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/fluxux-lunch.jpg"/></p>

<p>Later on, I went out to the world famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wat_Pho">Wat Pho</a> Buddhist temple, O.K maybe you don't know the place for that name, but perhaps you are familiar with the giant Reclining Buddha.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/giant-buddha-1.jpg"/>
<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>
<img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/wat-pho-2.jpg"/></p>

<p>But that Buddha is not the only interesting Buddha to see; the place is a compound of temples, Buddha, and halls full of Buddhas in all material, color, and sizes you can imagine, thousands and thousands of Buddhas, I totally recommend this spot in Bangkok.</p>

<p>My next stop lead me to another Buddhist temple <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wat_Rakhang">Wat Rakhang</a>, to be honest, I was planning a different temple, but the taxi driver recommends me this because was better that the first one I choose. Regarding sightseeing aspect, the temple was just fine; But maybe the interesting fact is that that place is a Buddhist University with a lot of people studying the Buddha philosophy.</p>

<br/><br/>
<img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/wat-rakhang-2.jpg"/></p>

<p>Also, the place has a pier in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chao_Phraya_River">Chao_Phraya</a> river, with a lot of tours for tourist like me, but I didn't take the option.</p>

                <title>Ayutthaya, Thailand - Drupal Tour 2016</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>In an effort to try to live a little more about the Thai experience. I decided to visit the city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phra_Nakhon_Si_Ayutthaya_(city)">Ayutthaya</a> located 80 kilometres from <strong>Bangkok</strong>.</p>

<p>To reach this place I decided to use the train because looks easy to do and it was, I took a second class ticket in the morning in a wagon with fans and returning and first class wagon with air condition.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/bangkok-rail-station.jpg"/>
<br/><br/>
<img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/ayutthaya-rail-station.jpg"/></p>

<p>In <strong>Ayutthaya</strong> I hire a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_rickshaw">tuk-tuk</a> for me, who promise to lead to all tourist sightseeing places in a marathon of 4 hours. I took because the driver was very kind and he spoke English, on the other hand, I found the price reasonable.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/ayutthaya-tuk-tuk.jpg"/></p>

<p>He leads me out to places like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wat_Chaiwatthanaram">Wat Chaiwatthanaram</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wat_Chaiwatthanaram">Wat Phra Si Sanphet</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wat_Ratchaburana,_Ayutthaya">Wat Ratchaburana</a> among other I could find in google, so just let me share some pictures.</p>

<br/><br/>
<img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/ayutthaya-6.jpg"/></p>

<p>As you can imagine, I finish my tour with a delicious Thai food for lunch.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/ayutthaya-lunch.jpg"/></p>

<p>I totally recommend this place to visit, everyday I found this place more interesting and I want to come back.</p>

                <title>Bangkok Day 3 - Drupal Tour 2016</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>Another day in the tropic and I decided to visit one of the main spots for tourists in Bangkok, which is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Palace">Grand Palace</a>.</p>

<p>Maybe was the fact was crowded as hell and the weather was heat as hell too, but I didn't enjoy this place as much as the rest of Thailand. But the place is beautiful; it's just too dense regarding buildings and temples.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/bangkok-royal-palace-1.jpg"/>
<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>
<img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/bangkok-royal-palace-4.jpg"/></p>

<p>For me, the most important aspect of my tour is about to meet people and having lunch with <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/svenryen">Sven</a> from Norway, that change my mood in a good way.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/lunch-with-sven.jpg"/></p>

<p>Finally, I visit the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumphini_Park">Lumphini Park</a>, as many parks in many cities is full of playgrounds, lake, boat, finding and why not giant lizards. Yep did you read correctly giant lizards, I don't know the reason bu they are there among kids, they look almost like Comodo Dragons.</p>

                <title>Traveling to Hong Kong - Drupal Tour 2016</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>In my last half day in Bangkok, I decided to stay at home and do some planning of sightseeing in Hong Kong, by the way, I am glad that I can use the web app <a href="http://www.visitacity.com">Visit a City</a> to create a schedule for my three days in Hong Kong.</p>

<p>Also, I did some planning with my wife to try to visit three days and two night <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmania">Tasmania</a>, and I realize two facts, A. Tasmania is bigger than Costa Rica, B. That will be the most south place I have been visited in my life.</p>

<p>In the flight, I have the opportunity to finish the book "The Fifth Woman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fifth_Woman) written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henning_Mankell">Henning Mankell</a>. I bought this book in a library in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewes_District">Lewes, UK</a> as part of a personal challenge to read literature in English among other books, and I left behind in Hong Kong.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/the-firth-woman.jpg"/></p>

<p>I abandon the book with a note to the person who find the book request to read and lead behind too or just give the book to someone else.</p>

                <title>Hong Kong Day 1 - Drupal Tour 2016</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>As I said before, for my Hong Kong is not China, for many reasons. First, one Hong Kong citizens don't have the same rights as other Chinese folks in the mainland ( Mainland identify areas outside Hong Kong and Macau). B. They have a different system of visas than Mainland and C. They are more English oriented than the rest of China.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I decided to don't visit a particular place, instead of I just visit some public spaces to feel the city, my first stop was in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kowloon_Park">Kowloon Park</a> a big green area in Hong Kong, which is weird, due the high prices of land. This place as I expected was full of Senior citizens practicing Thai Chi; the park is also used for cultural representation, and there is an Aviary in the middle of the park.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/kowloon-park-seniors.jpg"/>
<br/><br/>
<img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/kowloon-park-aviary.jpg"/>
<br/><br/>
<img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/kowloon-park-anime-statue.jpg"/></p>

<p>Later on, I went out to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kowloon_Park">West Kowloon Waterfront Promenade</a>, The area is under construction, but the Promenade is still there, with a good view of Hong Kong, but Hong Kong was cloudy, so the pictures are not totally clear.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/west-kowloon.jpg"/></p>

<p>After that, I walked in direction to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsim_Sha_Tsui">Tsim Sha Tsui</a> to see the promenade located there and take a ferry from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Harbour">Victoria Harbur</a></p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/hongkong-ferry.jpg"/>
<br/><br/>
<img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/hong-kong-island.jpg"/></p>

<p>In the other side is located the Hong Kong island, so I just roam between a network of bridges that connect upscale shopping malls, before to took a train to visit Dried Seafood Street located at [Des Voeux Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Des_Voeux_Road]. I was expecting something like a Chinatown but was clean and organized, but the food of course very exotic.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/dry-seafood-1.jpg"/>
<br/><br/>
<img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/dry-seafood-2.jpg"/>
<br/><br/>
<img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/dry-seafood-3.jpg"/></p>

<p>At night, I met with my friend <strong>Jackie Chang</strong> from <a href="http://bootdev.com">BootDev</a> to have a dinner and later on see other folks for a Drupal Happy Hour meetup.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/hong-kong-dinner-jackie.jpg"/></p>

<p>As always, was a great night with my friend Jackie.</p>

                <title>Hong Kong Drupal Meetup - Drupal Tour 2016</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>I had the opportunity to participate in the Hong Kong Drupal meetup. I have to say I liked their format; their schedule starts at 7 pm, But they reserve 1 hour to let people talk each other to enforce the networking and to allow people who to have some issues reaching to the place don't miss the sessions.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/hk-meetup-1.JPG"/>
<br/><br/>
<img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/hk-meetup-2.JPG"/></p>

<p>The first session was lead by <strong>Jackie Chan</strong> from <a href="http://bootdev.com">BootDev</a> where he share how DrupalCamp China was 2016](http://drupalcampchina.org/drupal%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E8%90%A5-2016/sessions/drupalconsole) held in Shanghai; maybe we will see a Drupal day or DrupalCamp Hong Kong soon.</p>

<p>Later on, I have the opportunity to present my session about <a href="http://drupalconsole">Drupal Console</a> including a live demo; People were keen about the product and the reception was incredible.</p>

<p>During day time as part of my sightseeing in Hong Kong I visited the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Museum_of_History">Hong Kong Museum of History</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wong_Tai_Sin_Temple_(Hong_Kong)">Wong Tai Sin Temple</a></p>

                <description><![CDATA[<p>Hong is bigger than I expected, and some stuff I want to do required 2 hours travel each way, so I have to change my plans.</p>

<p>After reviewing my options I went out to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_Mo_Temple_(Hong_Kong)">Man Mo Temple</a> which is a small but beautiful temple, actually looks like those millennial places we usually saw in Kung Fu movies</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/man-mo-temple-1.jpg"/>

<br/><br/>
<img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/man-mo-temple-3.jpg"/></p>

<p>After lunch, I return to my place, to work a little bit with other <a href="http://drupalconsole.com">Drupal Console</a> maintainers. I share with them my idea of increase the level complexity in our introduction session for Drupal Console; they agreed and, I will use that starting in <a href="http://2016.drupalcampmanila.com">Drupal Camp Manila</a> next week.</p>

<p>Later on, I walked in Nathan Street just to the environment and visited the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_Street,_Hong_Kong">Temple Street</a> and Lady's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tung_Choi_Street) markets, both places where do you could find anything do you have in mind, I didn't buy anything due I wasn't looking for something.</p>

<br/><br/>
<img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/lady-street-market.jpg"/></p>

<p>At night, I visited with <strong>Jackie</strong> and  <strong>Kevin</strong> from <a href="http://bootdev">Bootdev</a>, Jackie's parent's house, where his parents prepare a delicious dinner using Hongkonese style.</p>

                <title>Taipei Day 1 - Drupal Tour 2016</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>Starting in a new city never is easy, Taipei is not perfect, but works well, even that I got lost for a moment after took a bus I could fix my issue relatively quick.</p>

<p>This weekend is a long weekend due the labor day on Monday; I was alert about I will find all really crowded but not really.</p>

<p>I could split the sightseeing I did yesterday in three categories.</p>

<p>In the religious category, I visited three temples yesterday.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Jiantan Temple</strong></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mengjia_Longshan_Temple">Longshan Temple</a></li>
<li><strong>Qingshan Temple</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Among of those temples, the most interesting was the <strong>Longshan Temple</strong> and wasn't about the temple, was about people, Becuase inside were about half thousand people, chanting song and praying to their goods, was a nice experience.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/jiantan-temple.jpg"/></p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/longshan-temple.jpg"/></p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/qingshan-temple.jpg"/></p>

<p>About cultural section I visited, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Palace_Museum">National Palace Museum</a>; To be honest, I didn't really enjoy this place, maybe too much art, pottery, and calligraphy and I don't have the culture or knowledge to understand that.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/national-palace-museum.jpg"/></p>

<p>Regards national symbols, I went out to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiang_Kai-shek_Memorial_Hall">Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall</a>, this memorial honor the father of their country; I know it's delicate subject saying Taiwan is a country, but looks like a country and smell like a country.  In general a big plaza and a nice monument and they a changing guard show.</p>

                <title>Taipei Day 2 - Drupal Tour 2016</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>Another cloudy day in Taipei, so I skip again I had to postpone the visit to the <strong>Taipei 101</strong> building. Instead of I visit today other temples.</p>

<p>My first temple was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hsing_Tian_Kong">Xingtian Temple</a>; I was surprised because again the temple was crowded and in the middle of a religious service, I expect some time just to feel the environment.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/xingtian-temple-1.jpg"/></p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/xingtian-temple-2.jpg"/></p>

<p>Later on, I visited the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taipei_Confucius_Temple">Taipei Confucius Temple</a>, a beautiful complex that includes some artist performance some Asian instruments.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/taipei-confucius-temple-1.jpg"/></p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/taipei-confucius-temple-2.jpg"/></p>

<p>Almost in next door,  is located the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalongdong_Baoan_Temple">Baoan Temple</a> which is the biggest temple in Taipei and declared as UNESCO Asia-Pacific Heritage in 2003.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/baoan-temple-1.jpg"/></p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/baoan-temple-2.jpg"/></p>

<p>At that moment, I was tired of seeing temples, and I want to do something more mundane; So against my rules, I decided to try to find a movie theater to watch <strong>Civil War</strong> the latest Marvel movie.</p>

<p>Using my phone, I found a movie theater near to a metro station, wasn't hard to find, but I was expecting a mall with a cinema complex inside, but instead I found and small and independent movie theater, happily I could check the film was available in English with Chinese traditional subtitles. Being sincere I have to confess that I always use English subtitles to watch a movie if it's not available in Spanish, but I could say I understand about 80% of the film.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/movie-civil-war.jpg"/></p>

<p>Looking for something to eat I visited the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shilin_Night_Market">Shilin Night Market</a> a colorful place, especially regarding food variety; as a good tourist, I bought some stuff and ate in the traditional food court in the market.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/shilin-night-market-1.jpg"/></p>

                <description><![CDATA[<p>As I mentioned before, Monday are hard for tourist, because usually many stuff to do are close, but it's especially hard if the Monday is a holiday and yesterday was a holiday due a Labor day celebration.</p>

<p>In order to try to see something different and open in a holiday, I went out to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamsui_District">Tamsui </a> witch is a town in north of Taipei where there is a port in the conjuntion of river  Damsui with the ocean in the Taiwan Strait.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/tamsui-1.jpg"/></p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/tamsui-2.jpg"/></p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/tamsui-3.jpg"/></p>

<p>Parallel to the river there is a promenade with a bicycle route of about 10 km, I only walk about four kilometers to the end of the boardwalk where is locate the <strong>Tamsui Lover's Bridge</strong> in the Wharf.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/tamsui-love-1.jpg"/></p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/tamsui-love-3.jpg"/></p>

<p>In the afternoon, I meet with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kering-corrales-89815683">Kering Corrales</a> a Costa Rican how to arrive on the same day as me, by coincidence and I noticed via <a href="http://swarmapp.com">Swarn</a>. We met in <strong>Taipei 101</strong> building, and he explains me his life project of a new beginning in Taipei including of course learning Chinese and studies Computer Science.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/taipei-101.jpg"/></p>

<p>I skip the visit to the observatory deck, because the queue was hell long, I will return in two days just before departure.</p>

                <title>Taipei Day 4 - Drupal Tour 2016</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>One of the most important things in my [tour](http://enzolutions.com/articles/2016/01/19/around-the-drupal-world-in-120-days) is about community, about what I could share and about what I could learn from the people I met during it.</p>

<p>Yesterday, all my activities were oriented to the community. My first stop was in <a href="https://bigdata.com.tw">Big Data Taiwan</a>, there I have the opportunity to share with them about Drupal 8 and of course demonstrate the <a href="http://drupalconsole.com">Drupal Console</a> project.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/bigdata-taiwan-team.jpg"/></p>

<p>But, I had happily surprise about their other business outside web development with Drupal. I was especially surprise about their product <a href="https://goo9.io/">Goo9</a> this is a wearable device for diapers to help people to monitor the diaper status for babies and seniors, using an app, very impressive.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/goo9.png"/></p>

<p>In the afternoon, my second stop was with <a href="https://fliegen.com.tw">Fliegen</a> headquarters; After having a Drupal meetup last Friday, the tested the DrupalConsole and decide to contribute to Drupal Console.</p>

<p>Their first contribution will be an installer for Windows users that include Apache, Mysql, Php, Composer and Drupal Console. The installer is done, they just need to create an overview page to describe the installer and will be in English and Chinese traditional, so soon there will and alternative for Windows users that want to test Drupal Console.</p>

<p>Their second contribution will be a translation to Chinese traditional of Drupal Console project.</p>

<p>I appreciate those contributions and makes my trip worthable.</p>

                <description><![CDATA[<p>To finish my short visit to Taipei, I decided to learn something about local and recent history, so went out into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Museum_of_History">National Museum of History</a> of Taiwan.</p>

<p>The museum was OK, but the problem they used old ceramic, sculpture to tell their history. I am not said is not valid but wasn't the kind of history I was looking for; one acclamation is about the word <strong>old</strong> when I say old is old, several objects were label as made about six millenniums ago.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/taipei-museum-history-3.jpg"/></p>

<p>Fortunately, I have the company of the new residence <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kering-corrales-89815683">Kering Corrales</a> self-imported from Costa Rica, he could provide some comments about the beauty of the exposition, thanks for that.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/taipei-museum-history-4.jpg"/></p>

<p>In the afternoon I flu to Manila, Philippines to participate as Keynote and speaker in <a href="2016.drupalcampmanila.com">DrupalCamp Manila 2016</a></p>

                <title>Manila Day  1 - Drupal Tour 2016</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>Visiting a city is not just doing sightseeing, it's more than that, it's tried to understand their society, which their work based on their environment and their history, at least that is what I sought to do.</p>

<p>Being in Manila, Phillippines remember me the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083658">Blade Runner</a>, in the movie they use a "language" named <strong>Cityspeak</strong> which is a mixture of Spanish, French, German, Hungarian, Chinese, and Japanese, in the vision of what the future will be. Well, Phillippines were living that future a long time ago.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/blade-runner.jpeg"/></p>

<p>Before I came here, I already know they have to official languages English and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filipino_language">Filipino</a>, but I don't understand yet is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagalog_language">Tagalog</a> is equal to Filipino, but if it is not, they are close.</p>

<p>Back into the reference to <strong>Blade Runner</strong>; The Filipinos don't use English and Filipino languages separately.</p>

<p>In a conversation they start with English and in the middle they use a lot of Spanish words and introduce sentences in Filipino/Tagalog in the middle; I am not talking about in the street, I saw that in <a href="http://cnnphilippines.com">CNN Philippines</a>, that was exciting for me.</p>

<p>Concerning sightseeing, I visit the Churches of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila_Cathedral">Manila Cathedral</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Sebastian_Church_(Manila)">San Agustin Church</a>.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/manila-cathedral.jpg"/></p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/manila-san-agustin.jpg"/></p>

<p>In the cultural aspect, I visited the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Santiago">Fort Santiago</a> and structure used for Spanish, Japanese and the USA during their occupation of Philippines; the most remarkable think to see there was a museum decicated to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Rizal">Jose Rizal</a> a here that inspire the separation from Spain.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/fort-santiago.jpg"/></p>

<p>To ended up my day I visit the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_of_the_Filipino_People">Museum of the Filipino People</a> just to continue my learning about the country.</p>

                <description><![CDATA[<p>Indeed, death is part of our life, if the only thing everybody if sure is about the dead will wait for us. What Enzo smoked today you could be thinking right now, but I want to talk about a strong relation between life and death I see today in Manila.</p>

<p>After brunch, I went out to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila_North_Cemetery">Manila North Cemetery</a> this is the biggest cemetery in Phillippines and maybe one of the largest in the world. It's too big that they have an address system base in street and avenues, taxis and cars have free access to the commentary, but to be honest doesn't look like a cemetery, check the picture is just like a regular neighbourhood in a country in develop.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/manila-cementery-1.jpg"/></p>

<p>When I walk a little more in the graveyard I could identify people selling drinks, flower, and others, until here could be not weird for some people; But later I saw entire families with children in arms "living" in big mausoleums maybe never visited for their relatives. Why perhaps you ask, well living among dead people doesn't look so bad if your other option is living under a bridge or just on a sidewalk.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/manila-cementery-2.jpg"/></p>

<p>They look like very adapted to live here, and must to be a lot of people; because they have some basketball fields, and I found evidence that they are running a championship.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/manila-cementery-3.jpg"/></p>

<p>At the end as I said the cemetery looks like a neighborhood, so they just reuse the soil in their benefit.</p>

<p>Continuing with the sightseeing, I walk a lot due; I didn't realize how hard is take a taxi in Manila downtown. I visit the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masjid_Al-Dahab">Golden Mosque</a> to be honest nothing especial, but the Philippines is a Catholic country.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/manila-golden-musque.jpg"/></p>

<p>Nevertheless, around the mosque are thousands and thousands of street shop, where you can find anything inside this functional chaos.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/manila-street-shops.jpg"/></p>

<p>At night, I join with others foreigners that are in The Philippines for <a href="http://2016.drupalcampmanila.com">DrupalCamp Manila 2016</a>. Easily this could be an APAC Drupal Summit because:</p>

<ol>
<li>We have an <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/apec-blue-skies-fail-cheer-beijing-residents-government-rushes-clean-air-ahead-summit-1721371">APAC Blue Sky</a>.</li>
<li>We have people from 10 countries (Japan, Indonesia, India, Norway, USA, Singapore, Canada, Vietnam, Colombia, and  the Philippines)</li>
</ol>

                <title>Drupal Camp Manila Day 1 - Drupal Tour 2016</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>I was impressed with how international the Drupal Camp Manila was, with speakers from ten countries and sponsors from four countries, by far is one the most international events of Drupal I had attended.</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/manila-group.jpg"/></p>

<p>The assistance was about 200, again don't trust in my appreciation. I was honor by leading the Drupal Camp Keynote; in my talk, I present about "Why investing in community is good business".</p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/manila-keynote.jpg"/></p>

<p>Also, I did a session about Drupal Console, but this time was more advanced than usual, because some attendees from Singapore, Vietnam and Japon already watch the basic introduction during my <a href="enzolutions.com/articles/2016/01/19/around-the-drupal-world-in-120-days/">enzotour16</a></p>

<p><img style="margin-right: 20px;" src="http://enzolutions.com/assets/img/drupalconsole-manila.jpg"/></p>

<p>I attended some interesting sessions like Twig in Drupal 8, BeHat, Scrum among others.</p>

                <description><![CDATA[<p>Elections Day in the Philippines, to elected President, Vice-president, Senators, Mayors, and councilors. I found interested some fact of Pilipinos elections</p>

<p>The vote is electronic, people fill out a multiple choice form and then introduce in a machine that read, and voters review a receipt showing what the machine read,  and if they confirm the receipt and form are stored in the device.</p>

<p>Voters register their point finger fingerprint and get an ink mark in their nail to avoid anyone vote again.</p>

<p>The military forces can vote.</p>

<p>Propaganda outside the schools where people vote is not allowed. Here some pictures of the experience of elections after companion <strong>Paul de Paula</strong> to vote.</p>
