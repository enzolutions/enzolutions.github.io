                <title>How to configure MySQL to import large database</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>On many occasions we need to install in our local enviroment a copy of production sites for development or debugging process, this entails that need to import large databases.</p>

<p>The most common error is that you cannot import the database because for some reason you loose the communication with the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> server, as shown below.</p>

<pre><code>$ /mysql -f -uroot -proot mydb -h 127.0.0.1 &lt; ~/Downloads/prod-mysql-2013-01-29.sql
ERROR 2006 (HY000) at line 6565: MySQL server has gone away
</code></pre>

<p>To fix this error you must to change the default configuration of MySQL.</p>

<p>MySQL store his configuration in a file commonly named my.cnf and could be located in different locations depending the OS version you have installed.</p>

<p>If you do not know the location of this file, you can use the following command shown below to determine where you expect to find locations MySQL settings.</p>

<pre><code>$ ./mysql --help | grep my.cnf
/etc/my.cnf /etc/mysql/my.cnf /Applications/MAMP/conf/my.cnf ~/.my.cnf
</code></pre>

<p>In my case I had MySQL as part of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mamp.info/">MAMP</a> and this file is not created by default. For this reason I will create a new file located at <em>/Applications/MAMP/conf/my.cnf</em> becuase is one of the location where MySQL will look his configuration file.</p>

<p>I recommend to use the sample provided by MySQL documentation for large databases localed at <em>/usr/share/doc/mysql-server-5.0/examples/my-large.cnf.gz.</em></p>

<p>After copy the suggested configuration from documantion, I have to apply two changes to warranty the import process don't fail.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Remove Directive # <em>skip-locking</em></p></li>
<li><p>Increase setting <em>max_allowed_packet = 100M</em></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Then just be enough restart the MySQL server and try to import the database again.</p>

<p>You can check my version of my.cnf <a target="_blank" href="http://7sabores.com/sites/default/files/my.cnf_.txt">here</a></p>

                <title>My blog is alive again!</title>
                <description><![CDATA[<p>Hello folks.</p>

<p>After many years without touch my personal website, I took the decision to put it back online.</p>

<p>Recently I have been writing technical documentation in Spanish in the website <a href="http://7sabores.com" target="_blank">7Sabores.com</a>. If you are wondering Why in Spanish? and if you read Spanish you can find my justification in the blog entry <a href='http://7sabores.com/blog/se-busca-en-espanol'>¿Se busca en Español?</a>.</p>

<p>I will not translate all my Spanish entries to English or viceversa, all depends my mood :P.</p>

<p>Also I have to say THANKS YOU to two great products <a targe="_blank" href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> and <a href="http://spress.yosymfony.com/">[S]press</a>. Without them this blog couldn't be possible.</p>

<p>See you around.</p>
